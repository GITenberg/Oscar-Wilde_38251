<p>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:</p>

<p>This e-book contains one phrase in ancient Greek, which may not display
properly depending on the fonts the user has installed. Hover the mouse over
the Greek phrase to view a transliteration, e.g.,
<span lang="el" title="Greek: logos">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>Blank pages have been removed from the text.  Some page numbers are missing
as a result.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in the author's use of hyphens and accent marks have
been left unchanged, as in the original text. Obvious typographical
errors have been corrected without comment. One example of a typographical
error is on page 144 where the word "miuutes" was corrected to
"minutes".  In cases other than obvious typographical errors, the author's
spelling has been left unchanged from the original text with the following
three exceptions:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Page 126 the word "worldings" was changed to "worldlings" in the phrase:
"... guests are all mere worldlings...."</p>

<p>2. Page 262 the quoted phrase: "Fait vour quelle sera votre votre maturité"
was changed to: "Fait voir quelle sera votre maturité" which is the correct
wording from the poem "À Théodore de Banville" by Charles Baudelaire.</p>

<p>3. Page 317 the name "Bazil" was changed to "Basil" in the phrase:
"Basil Hallward's studio" to correspond with the author's other spellings
of the name Basil Hallward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two items in the index, which were out of alphabetical order ("De
Profundis&mdash;Biblical influence" and "Shaw, G. B.") were placed in correct
alphabetical order in this version.</p>

<h2>OSCAR WILDE</h2>

<p class="center big">THE MAN</p>


<p>The <span lang="el" title="Greek: synetoi">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span>, the connoisseurs, always recognised
the genius of Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills
Wilde from the very first moment when he
began to write. For many years ordinary people
to whom literature and literary affairs were not
of, at anyrate, absorbing interest only knew of
Oscar Wilde by his extravagances and poses.</p>

<p>Then it happened that Wilde turned his
powers in the direction of the stage and achieved
a swift and brilliant success. The English public
then began to realise that here was an unusually
brilliant man, and the extraordinary genius of
the subject of this work would have certainly
been universally recognised in a few more years,
when the shocking scandals associated with his
name occurred and Oscar Wilde disappeared
into oblivion.</p>

<p>A great change gradually took place in public
opinion. Little by little the feeling of prejudice
against the work of Oscar Wilde began to die
away. The man himself was dead. He had
expiated his crimes by a prolonged agony of
the most hideous suffering and disgrace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
people began to wonder if his writings were in any
way associated with the dark side of his life and
character, or whether they might not, after all, be
beautiful, pure, and treasures of the literature of
our time. The four comedies of Manners, "Lady
Windermere's Fan," "The Ideal Husband," "A
Woman Of No Importance," "The Importance
Of Being Earnest," everyone had seen and
laughed at. They were certainly absolutely
without offence. It was gradually seen that
because a house was built by an architect of an
immoral private life that did not necessarily
invalidate it as a residence, that if Stephenson
had ended his life upon the gallows people would
still find railways convenient and necessary.
The truth gradually dawned that Wilde had
never in his life written a line that was immoral
or impure, and that, in short, the criminal side
of him was only a part of his complex nature,
horribly disastrous for himself and his personal
life, but absolutely without influence upon his
work.</p>

<p>Art and his aberration never mingled or overlapped.
Everybody began to realise the fact.</p>

<p>Opinion was also being quietly moulded from
within by a band of literary and artistic people,
some of them friends of the late author, others
knowing him simply through his work.</p>

<p>The public began to ask for Wilde's books
and found it almost impossible to obtain them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
for the "Ballad of Reading Gaol," published
while its author was still alive, had not stimulated
any general demand for other works.</p>

<p>It was after Oscar Wilde's death that his
friends and admirers were able to set to work at
their endeavours to rehabilitate him as artist in
the mind of general prejudice. Books and monographs
were written about Wilde in English,
French, and German. He was quoted in the
leading Continental reviews. His play "Salomé"
met with sudden and stupendous success all over
Europe, a famous musician turned it into an
opera. A well-known English man of letters,
Mr Robert Harborough Sherard, published a
final official "Life" of the dead author, and
Wilde's own "De Profundis" appeared to
startle, sadden, and thrill the whole reading
world.</p>

<p>His plays are being revived, and an authoritative
and exhaustive edition of his writings is
being issued by a leading publishing house.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about it, the most prejudiced
and hostile critics must admit it&mdash;in a
literary sense, as a man of letters with extraordinary
genius, Oscar Wilde has come into his
own. The time is, therefore, ripe for a work of
the present character which endeavours to "appreciate"
one of the strangest, saddest, most
artistic and powerful brains of modern times.
Five years ago such a book as this would probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
have been out of place. When Balzac
died Sainte-Beuve prefaced a short critical article
of fourteen pages, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A careful study of the famous novelist who
has just been taken from us, and whose sudden
loss has excited universal interest, would require
a whole work, and the time for that, I think, has
not yet come. Those sort of moral autopsies
cannot be made over a freshly dug grave, especially
when he who has been laid in it was
full of strength and fertility, and seemed still
full of future works and days. All that is possible
and fitting in respect of a great contemporary
renown at the moment death lays it low
is to point out, by means of a few clear-cut lines,
the merits, the varied skill, by which it charmed
its epoch and acquired influence over it."</p></blockquote>

<p>When Oscar Wilde died, and before the
publication of "De Profundis," various short
essays did, as I have stated, make an appearance.
A longer work seems called for, and it
is that want which the present volume does its
best to supply.</p>

<p>"Oscar Wilde: The Man" is the title of the
first part of this Appreciation. In Mr Sherard's
"The Story of an Unhappy Friendship," as also
in his careful and scholarly "Life," the many-sided
nature of Oscar Wilde was set forth with
all the ability of a brilliant pen. But there is
yet room for another, and possibly more detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
point of view, and also a summary of the views
of others which will assist the general reader to
gain a mental picture of a writer whose works,
in a very short time, are certain to have a
general, as well as a particular appeal.</p>

<p>The scheme of a work of this nature, which is
critical rather than biographical, would nevertheless
be incomplete without a personal study.</p>

<p>The study of Wilde's writings cannot fail to
be enormously assisted by some knowledge of
synetoithe man himself, and how he was regarded by
others both before and after his personal disgrace.</p>

<p>Ever since his name was known to the world
at all the public view of him has constantly been
shifting and changing. There are, however, four
principal periods during each of which Wilde
was regarded in a totally different way. I have
made a careful analysis of each of these periods
and collected documentary and other evidence
which defines and explains them.</p>

<p>The first period of all&mdash;Oscar Wilde himself
always spoke of the different phases of his extraordinary
career as "periods"&mdash;was that of the
"Æsthetic movement" as it is generally called,
or the æsthetic "craze" as many people prefer
to name it still. New movements, whether good
or bad in their conception and ultimate result,
always excite enmity, hostility, and ridicule. In
affairs, in religion, in art, this is an invariable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
rule. No pioneer has ever escaped it. England
laughed at the first railway, jeered at the
volunteer movement and laughed at John Keats
in precisely the same fashion as it ridiculed
Oscar Wilde and the æsthetic movement.</p>

<p>It is as well to define that movement carefully,
for, though marred by innumerable extravagances
and still suffering from the inanities
of its first disciples, it has nevertheless had a
real and permanent influence upon English life.
Oscar Wilde was, of course, not the originator
of the æsthetic movement. He took upon
himself to become its hierophant, and to infuse
much that was peculiarly his own into it. The
movement was begun by Ruskin, Rossetti,
William Morris, Burne-Jones, and a host of
others, while it was continued in the delicate
and beautiful writings of Walter Pater. But
it had always been an eclectic movement, not
for the public eye or ear, neither known of nor
popular with ordinary people.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde then began to interest and excite
England and America in the true aims and
methods of art of all kinds. It shows an
absolute ignorance of the late Victorian era to
say that the movement was a passing craze. To
Oscar Wilde we owe it that people of refined
tastes but moderate means can obtain beautiful
papers for the walls of their houses at a moderate
cost. The cheap and lovely fabrics that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
can buy in Regent Street are spun as a direct
consequence of the movement; harmony and
delicacy of colour, beauty of curve and line, the
whole renaissance of art in our household furniture
are mainly due to the writings and lectures
of Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>It is not a crime to love beautiful things, it is
not effeminate to care for them. It is to the
subject of this appreciation we owe our national
change of feeling on such matters.</p>

<p>This, briefly, is what the æsthetic movement
was, such are its indubitable results. Let us
see, in some instances, how Wilde was regarded
in the period when, before his real literary successes,
he preached the gospel of Beauty in
everyday life.</p>

<p>Let us take a Continental view of Wilde in his
first period, the view of a really eminent man, a
distinguished scientist and man of letters.</p>

<p>The name of Dr Max Nordau will be familiar
to many readers of this book. But, if the book
fulfils the purpose for which it was designed,
then possibly there will be many readers who
will know little or nothing of the distinguished
foreign writer. Hard, one-sided, and bitter as
his remarks upon Wilde during the æsthetic
movement will seem to most of us&mdash;seem to me&mdash;yet
they have the merit of absolute detachment
and sincerity. It is as well to insist on this fact
in order that my readers may realise exactly such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
value as the words may have, no less and no
more. The following short account of Dr Max
Nordau's position and achievements is taken from
that useful dictionary of celebrities, "Who's
Who?" for 1907:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Nordau, Max Simon</span>, M.D. Paris, Budapesth;

<p>Nearly all the modern manifestations of Art,
implies Dr Max Nordau, in "Degeneration," are
manifestations of madness. Such a sweeping
statement is incredible and has not&mdash;nor will
it have&mdash;many advocates, despite the brilliant
special pleading of its originator. In Oscar
Wilde's case the aphorism seems particularly
misleading for the reason that there may appear
to be a considerable amount of truth in it.</p>

<p>That Wilde's <i>social</i> downfall was due to a
certain kind of elliptiform insanity is without
doubt. Mr Sherard has insisted on this over and
over again. He has spent enormous labour in
researches into Wilde's ancestry. His view is
really a scientific view because it is written by
an artist who sees both sides of the question, has
a judicial mind, and while capable of appreciating
the truths that science teaches us, is further capable
of welding them to the psychological truths
which the intuition of the artist alone evolves.</p>

<p>A certain definite and partial insanity alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
can explain Wilde's life in certain of its aspects.
But when once his pen was in his hand, in his
real bright life of literature and art, this hidden
thing entirely disappears. Therefore, Dr Max
Nordau's study seems to me fundamentally
wrong, though extremely interesting and not
to be disregarded. To know Oscar Wilde we
must know what all sorts of people, whose
opinion has weight enough to secure a wide
hearing, really thought about him.</p>

<p>The German scientist said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The ego-mania of decadentism, its love of the
artificial, its aversion to nature, and to all forms
of activity and movement, its megalomaniacal
contempt for men and its exaggeration of the
importance of art, have found their English
representative among the 'Æsthetes,' the chief
of whom is Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>"Wilde has done more by his personal eccentricities
than by his works. Like Barbey
d'Aurevilly, whose rose-coloured silk hats and
gold lace cravats are well known, and like his
disciple Joséphin Péladan, who walks about in
lace frills and satin doublet, Wilde dresses in
queer costumes which recall partly the fashions
of the Middle Ages, partly the rococo modes.
He pretends to have abandoned the dress of the
present time because it offends his sense of the
beautiful; but this is only a pretext in which
probably he himself does not believe. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
really determines his actions is the hysterical
craving to be noticed, to occupy the attention
of the world with himself, to get talked about.
It is asserted that he has walked down Pall Mall
in the afternoon dressed in doublet and breeches,
with a picturesque biretta on his head, and a
sunflower in his hand, the quasi-heraldic symbol
of the Æsthetes. This anecdote has been reproduced
in all the biographies of Wilde, and I have
nowhere seen it denied. But it is a promenade
with a sunflower in the hand also inspired by a
craving for the beautiful.</p>

<p>"Phrasemakers are perpetually repeating the
twaddle, that it is a proof of honourable independence
to follow one's own taste without being
bound down to the regulation costume of the
Philistine cattle, and to choose for clothes the
colours, materials and cut which appear beautiful
to oneself, no matter how much they may
differ from the fashion of the day. The answer
to this cackle should be that it is above all a sign
of anti-social ego-mania to irritate the majority
unnecessarily, only to gratify vanity, or an
æsthetical instinct of small importance and easy
to control&mdash;such as is always done when, either
by word or deed, a man places himself in opposition
to this majority. He is obliged to repress
many manifestations of opinions and desires out
of regard for his fellow-creatures; to make him
understand this is the aim of education, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
who has not learnt to impose some restraint upon
himself in order not to shock others is called
by malicious Philistines, not an Æsthete, but a
blackguard.</p>

<p>"It may become a duty to combat the vulgar
herd in the cause of truth and knowledge; but
to a serious man this duty will always be felt as
a painful one. He will never fulfil it with a light
heart, and he will examine strictly and cautiously
if it be really a high and imperative law which
forces him to be disagreeable to the majority
of his fellow-creatures. Such an action is, in
the eyes of a moral and sane man, a kind of
martyrdom for a conviction, to carry out which
constitutes a vital necessity; it is a form, and
not an easy form, of self-sacrifice, for it means
the renunciation of the joy which the consciousness
of sympathy with one's fellow-creatures
gives, and it exacts the painful overthrow of
social instincts, which, in truth, do not exist in
deranged ego-maniacs, but are very strong in the
normal man.</p>

<p>"The predilection for strange costume is a
pathological aberration of a racial instinct. The
adornment of the exterior has its origin in the
strong desire to be admired by others&mdash;primarily
by the opposite sex&mdash;to be recognised by them
as especially well shaped, handsome, youthful, or
rich and powerful, or as pre-eminent through
rank or merit. It is practised, then, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
object of producing a favourable impression on
others, and is a result of thought about others,
of preoccupation with the race. If, now, this
adornment be, not through misjudgment but
purposely, of a character to cause irritation to
others, or lend itself to ridicule&mdash;in other words,
if it excites disapproval instead of approbation&mdash;it
then runs exactly counter to the object of
the art of dress, and evinces a perversion of the
instinct of vanity.</p>

<p>"The pretence of a sense of beauty is the excuse
of consciousness for a crank of the conscious.
The fool who masquerades in Pall Mall does not
see himself, and, therefore, does not enjoy the
beautiful appearance which is supposed to be an
æsthetic necessity for him. There would be
some sense in his conduct if it had for its object
an endeavour to cause others to dress in accordance
with his taste; for them he sees and they
can scandalise him by the ugliness, and charm
by the beauty, of their costume. But to take
the initiative in a new artistic style in dress
brings the innovator not one hair's breadth nearer
his assumed goal of æsthetic satisfaction.</p>

<p>"When, therefore, an Oscar Wilde goes about
in 'æsthetic costume' among gazing Philistines,
exciting either their ridicule or their wrath, it is
no indication of independence of character, but
rather from a purely anti-socialistic, ego-maniacal
recklessness and hysterical longing to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
sensation, justified by no exalted aim; nor is it
from a strong desire of beauty, but from a malevolent
mania for contradiction."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to read the extracts quoted
above&mdash;and only a few paragraphs sufficient to
show the trend of a much longer article have
been used&mdash;without realising its injustice and
yet at the same time its perfect sincerity. During
the "first period," with which we are dealing
now, Wilde undoubtedly excited the enmity
and ridicule of a vast number of people. He
knew that he had something to say which was
worth listening to. He knew also&mdash;as the genius
always has known&mdash;that he was superior in
intellect to those by whom he was surrounded.
His temperament was impatient. He wanted
to take the place to which he felt he was entitled
in a sudden moment. His quick Celtic imagination
ran riot with fact, his immeasurable ambition,
his serene consciousness of worth, which to usual
minds and temperaments suggested nothing but
conceit, all urged him to display and extravagance
in order to more speedily mount the
rostrum from which he would be heard.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this first period of this so
astonishing a career, he went far to spoil and
obscure his message by the very means he hoped
would enable him to publish it widely. He invented
a pose which he intended should become
a megaphone, whereas, in the effect, it did but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
retard the hearing of his voice until the practical
wisdom of what he wished to say proved itself
in concrete form.</p>

<p>Nor must we ever forget the man's constant
sense of humour, a mocking sprite which doubtless
led him to this or that public foolishness
while he chuckled within at his own attitude and
the dance he was leading his imitators and fools.
For Oscar Wilde had a supreme sense of
humour. Many people would like to deny him
<i>humour</i>, while admitting his marvellous and
scintillating <i>wit</i>. That they are wrong I unhesitatingly
assert, and I believe that this will
be proved over and over again in the following
pages.</p>

<p>Let us take another view of Wilde at this
period. It was written after his disappearance
from public life, or rather when it was imminent
and certain. The words are those of Mr
Labouchere, the <i>flaneur</i> with an intellect, the
somewhat acid critic of how many changing
aspects and phases of English social life.</p>

<p>"I have known Oscar Wilde off and on for
years," writes Mr Labouchere in <i>Truth</i>.
"Clever and witty he unquestionably is, but I
have always regarded him as somewhat wrong in
the head, for his craving after notoriety seemed
to me a positive craze. There was nothing that
he would not do to attract attention. When he
went over to New York he went about dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in a bottle-green coat with a waist up to his
shoulders. When he entered a restaurant people
threw things at him. When he drove in the
evening to deliver his lectures the windows of
his carriage were broken, until a policeman rode
on each side of it. Far from objecting to all
this, it filled him with delighted complacency.
'Insult me, throw mud at me, but only look
at me,' seemed to be his creed; and such a
creed was never acted upon by anyone whose
mind was not out of balance. So strange and
wondrous is his mind, when in an abnormal condition,
that it would not surprise me if he were
deriving a keen enjoyment from a position which
most people, whether really innocent or guilty,
would prefer to die rather than occupy. He
must have known in what a glass house he lived
when he challenged investigation in a court of
justice. After he had done this he went abroad.
Why did he not stay abroad? The possibilities
of a prison may not be pleasing to him, but I
believe that the notoriety that has overtaken
him has such a charm for him that it outweighs
everything else. I remember, in the early days
of the cult of æstheticism, hearing someone ask
him how a man of his undoubted capacity could
make such a fool of himself. He gave this
explanation. He had written, he said, a book of
poems, and he believed in their excellence. In
vain he went from publisher to publisher asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
them to bring them out: no one would even
read them, for he was unknown. In order to
find a publisher he felt that he must do something
to become a personality. So he hit upon
æstheticism. It succeeded. People talked about
him; they invited him to their houses as a sort
of lion. He then took his poems to a publisher,
who&mdash;still without reading them&mdash;gladly accepted
them."</p>

<p>This is thoroughly unsympathetic, but no
doubt it represents a mood with some faithfulness.
In criticising the work of critics one <i>must
be a psychologist</i>. Religion, the Christian religion
at anyrate, teaches tolerance. Its teachings
are seldom obeyed. The four Hags of the
litany&mdash;let us personify them!&mdash;Envy, Hatred,
Malice, and Uncharitableness unfortunately intrude
into religious life too often and too powerfully.
But the real psychologist, not the
scientist (<i>vide</i> Nordau) <i>is</i> able to understand
better than anyone else the motives which have
animated criticism at any given date. The
psychologist more than any other type of man
or woman has learnt the lesson Charles Reade
tried to inculcate in "Put Yourself In His
Place."</p>

<p>With a little effort, we can realise what
<i>Truth</i> thought when these lines were written.
We cannot blame the writer, we can only record
his words as a part of the general statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
dealing with Oscar Wilde's life and attitude
during the "Æsthetic Period."</p>

<p>At this point the reader may possibly ask
himself if the title given to the book&mdash;"Oscar
Wilde: an Appreciation"&mdash;is entirely justified.
"The writer of it," he may say to himself, "is
giving us examples of hostile criticism of Wilde's
first period, and though he endeavours to explain
them, yet, in an appreciation, it rather seems that
such quotations are out of place."</p>

<p>I do not think that if the point of view is
considered for a moment, the stricture will be
persisted in.</p>

<p>Eulogy, indiscriminating eulogy, is simply an
<i>ex parte</i> statement which can have no weight at
all. I shall endeavour to show, before this first
part of the book is completed, not only how
those who attacked Wilde were mistaken, not
only how those who bestowed indiscriminate
praise upon him made an over-statement, but
finally and definitely what Wilde was as seen
through the temperament of the writer, corrected
by the statements of other writers both for and
against him.</p>

<p>I am convinced that this is the only scientific
method of arriving at a just estimation of the
character of this brilliant and extraordinary man.
No summing up of the æsthetic period could be
complete without copious references to the great
chronicler of our modern life&mdash;the pages of Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Punch.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> has never been bitter. It has often
been severe, but Mr Punch has always, from
the very first moment of his arrival among us,
successfully held the balance between this or
that faction, and, moreover, has faithfully reflected
the consensus of public opinion upon
any given matter.</p>

<p>The extraordinary skill with which some of
the brightest and merriest wits have made our
national comic paper the true diary of events
cannot be controverted or disputed. Follies and
fashions have been criticised with satire, but
never with spleen. Addison said that the
"appearance of a man of genius in the world
may always be known by the virulence of
dunces." <i>Punch</i> has proved for generations
that its kindly appreciation or depreciation has
never been virulent, but nearly always an
accurate statement of the opinion and point
of view of the ordinary more or less cultured
and well-bred person.</p>

<p>It has always been a sign of eminence in this
or that department of life to be mentioned in
<i>Punch</i> at all. The conductors of that journal
during its whole career have always exercised
the wisest discrimination, and have always kept
shrewd fingers upon the pulses of English
thought. When a politician, for example, is
caricatured in <i>Punch</i> that politician knows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
he has arrived at a certain place and point in
public estimation. When a writer is caricatured,
either in line or words, he also knows that he
has, at anyrate, obtained a hold of this or that
sort upon the country.</p>

<p>Now those who would try to minimise the
place of Oscar Wilde in the public eye during
the æsthetic period have only to look at the
pages of <i>Punch</i> to realise how greatly that
movement influenced English life during its
continuance.</p>

<p>Let it be thoroughly understood&mdash;and very
few people will attempt to deny it&mdash;that <i>Punch</i>
has always been a perfectly adjusted barometer
of celebrity.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not out of place, herein, to
publish a bibliography of the references to Oscar
Wilde which, from first to last of that cometlike
career, appeared in the pages of Mr Punch.
Such a list proves immediately the one-sidedness
of Dr Max Nordau's and Mr Labouchere's views.
From extracts I have given from the remarks of
these two eminent people the ordinary man
might well be inclined to think that the æsthetic
movement and the doings of Oscar Wilde in his
first period were small and local things. This is
not so, and the following carefully compiled list
will show that it is not so.</p>

<p>The list has been properly indexed and is now
given below. Afterwards I shall give a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
selection from the witticisms of the famous
journal to support the bibliography.</p>

<p>Those students of the work of Oscar Wilde
and his position in modern life will find the
references below of great interest. They date
from 1881 to 1906, and those collectors of
"Oscariana" and students of Wilde's work will
doubtless be able to obtain the numbers in which
the following articles, poems, and paragraphs
have appeared.</p>

a recognition of the importance of the Æsthetic
movement.</p>

<p>Especially did the American lecturing tour of
Oscar Wilde excite the comment and ridicule of
<i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>I quote some paragraphs from a pretended
despatch from an "American correspondent."</p>

<blockquote><p class="center big">A POET'S DAY</p>

<p>"You see I am, after all, but mortal," remarked the Poet, with an
ineffable affable smile, as he looked up from an elegant but
substantial dish of ham and eggs. Passing a long, willowy hand
through his waving hair, he swept away a stray curl-paper with the
<i>nonchalance</i> of a <span class="smcap">D'orsay</span>.</p>

<p>After this effort, Mr <span class="smcap">Wilde</span> expressed himself as feeling somewhat
faint; and, with a half-apologetic smile, ordered another portion of</p>

<p class="center big">HAM AND EGGS</p>

<p>in the evident enjoyment of which, after a brief interchange of
international courtesies, I left the Poet.</p></blockquote>

<p>The irresponsible but not ungenial and quite
legitimate fun of this is a fairly representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
indication of the way in which the young "Apostle
of Beauty" was thought of in England during
his American visit.</p>

<p>The writer goes on to tell how, later in the
day, he once more encountered the "young
patron of Culture." It is astonishing to us now
to realise how even the word "culture" was distorted
from its real meaning and made into the
badge of a certain set. At anyrate, Mr Punch's
contributor goes on to say that "Oscar" was
found at the business premises of the</p>

<blockquote><p class="center big">CO-OPERATIVE DRESS ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>On this occasion the Poet, by special request,
appeared in the uniform of an English Officer of
the Dragoon Guards, the dress, I understand,
being supplied for the occasion from the elegant
wardrobe of Mr <span class="smcap">D'oyley Carte's</span> "Patience"
Company.</p>

<p>Several ladies expressed their disappointment
at the "insufficient leanness" of the Poet's figure,
whereupon his Business Manager explained that
he belonged to the fleshy school.</p>

<p>To accommodate Mr <span class="smcap">Wilde</span>, the ordinary lay-figures
were removed from the showroom, and,
after a sumptuous luncheon, to which the <i>élite</i> of
Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s customers were invited, the distinguished
guest posed with his fair hostess in an
allegorical tableau, representing <i>English Poetry
extending the right hand to American Commerce</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is indeed Fair Trade," remarked Mr
Wilde lightly, and immediately improvised a
testimonial advertisement (in verse) in praise of
Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s patent dress-improver.</p>

<p>At a dinner given by <span class="smcap">"Jemmy" Crowder</span>
(as we familiarly call him), the Apologist of Art
had discarded his military garb for the ordinary
dress of an</p>

<p class="center big">ENGLISH GENTLEMAN</p>

<p>in which his now world-famed knee-breeches
form a conspicuous item, suggesting indeed the
Admiral's uniform in Mr <span class="smcap">D'Oyley Carte's</span>
"Pinafore" combination.</p>

<p>"I think," said the Poet, in a pause between
courses, "one cannot dine too well"&mdash;placing
everyone at his ease by his admirable tact in
partaking of the thirty-six items of the <i>menu</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The skit continues wittily enough, but it is
not necessary to quote more of it. The paragraphs
sufficiently explain the attitude of Mr
Punch, which was the general attitude at the
time.</p>

<p>It was hammered in persistently. "Oscar
Interviewed" appeared under the date of January
1882, and again, in the following extracts the
reader will recognise the same note.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Determined</span> to anticipate the rabble of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
penny-a-liners ready to pounce upon any distinguished
foreigner who approaches our shores, and
eager to assist a sensitive Poet in avoiding the impertinent
curiosity and ill-bred insolence of the Professional
Reporter, I took the fastest pilot-boat
on the station, and boarded the splendid Cunard
steamer, the <i>Boshnia</i>, in the shucking of a peanut."</p>

<p class="center big">HIS ÆSTHETIC APPEARANCE</p>

<p>He stood, with his large hand passed through
his long hair, against a high chimney-piece&mdash;which
had been painted pea-green, with panels
of peacock-blue pottery let in at uneven intervals&mdash;one
elbow on the high ledge, the other hand
on his hip. He was dressed in a long, snuff-coloured,
single-breasted coat, which reached to
his heels, and was relieved with a sealskin collar
and cuffs rather the worse for wear. Frayed
linen, and an orange silk handkerchief, gave a
note to the generally artistic colouring of the
<i>ensemble</i>, while one small daisy drooped despondently
in his buttonhole.... We may state
that the chimney-piece, as well as the sealskin
collar, is the property of <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, and will appear
in his Lectures "on the Growth of Artistic
Taste in England."</p>

<p class="center big">HE SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF</p>

<p>"Yes; I should have been astonished had I not
been interviewed! Indeed, I have not been well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
on board this Cunard <i>Argosy</i>. I have wrestled
with the glaukous-haired Poseidon, and feared
his ravishment. Quite: I have been too ill, too
utterly ill. Exactly&mdash;seasick in fact, if I must
descend to so trivial an expression. I fear the
clean beauty of my strong limbs is somewhat
waned. I am scarcely myself&mdash;my nerves are
thrilling like throbbing violins&mdash;in exquisite
pulsation.</p>

<p>"You are right. I believe I was the first to
devote my subtle brain-chords to the worship
of the Sunflower, and the apotheosis of the
delicate Tea-pot. I have ever been jasmine-cradled
from my youth. Eons ago, I might
say centuries, in '78, when a student at Oxford,
I had trampled the vintage of my babyhood,
and trod the thorn-spread heights of Poesy. I
had stood in the Arena and torn the bays from
the expiring athletes, my competitors."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center big">LECTURE PROSPECTS</p>

<p>"Yes; I expect my Lecture will be a success.
So does <span class="smcap">Dollar Carte</span>&mdash;I mean <span class="smcap">D'Oyley
Carte</span>. Too-Toothless Senility may jeer, and
poor, positive Propriety may shake her rusty curls;
but I am here in my creamy lustihood, to pipe of
Passion's venturous Poesy, and reap the scorching
harvest of Self-Love! I am not quite sure
what I mean. The true Poet never is. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
true Poetry is nothing if it is intelligible. She
is only to be compared to <span class="smcap">Salmacis</span>, who is not
a boy or girl, but yet is both."</p></blockquote>

<p>And so forth, and so forth.</p>

<p>About the conversation and superficial manner
of Oscar Wilde there must have been something
strangely according to formula. Among intimate
friends, friends who were sympathetic to
his real ideals, his talk was wonderful. That
fact is vouched for in a hundred quarters, it is
not to be denied.</p>

<p>As I write I have dozens of undeniable testimonies
to the fact, I myself can bear witness to
it on at least one occasion. But when Wilde
was not with people for whose opinion of him he
cared much&mdash;really cared&mdash;his odd perversity of
phrase, his persistent wish to astonish the fools,
his extraordinary carelessness of average opinion
often compelled him to talk the most frantic
nonsense which was only redeemed from mere
childish inversion of phrase by the air and manner
with which it was said, and the merest tinsel
pretence of wit. The wittiest talker of his generation,
certainly the wittiest writer, gave the very
worst of his wit to the pressmen who pestered
him but who, and this was the thing he was unable
to appreciate at its true value, represented
him to the world during this "first period."</p>

<p>The mock interviews in <i>Punch</i> which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
been quoted from are really no very wide departures
from the real thing. A year or two after
the Æsthetic movement was not so prominent in
the public eye as was the success of Wilde as a
writer of plays, an actual interview with him
appeared in a well-known weekly paper in which
he talked not much less extravagantly than he
was caricatured as talking in <i>Punch</i>. A play of
his had been produced and, while it was a complete
and satisfying success, it had been assailed
in that unfortunately hostile way by the critics
to which he was accustomed.</p>

<p>He was asked what he thought about the
attitude of the critics towards his play.</p>

<p>"For a man to be a dramatic critic," he is said
to have replied, "is as foolish and inartistic as it
would be for a man to be a critic of epics, or a
pastoral critic, or a critic of lyrics. All modes
of art are one, and the modes of the art that
employs words as its medium are quite indivisible.
The result of the vulgar specialisation of
criticism is an elaborate scientific knowledge of
the stage&mdash;almost as elaborate as that of the
stage-carpenter, and quite on a par with that of
the call-boy&mdash;combined with an entire incapacity
to realise that a play is a work of art, or to
receive any artistic impressions at all."</p>

<p>He was told that he was rather severe upon
the dramatic critics.</p>

<p>"English dramatic criticism of our own day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
has never had a single success, in spite of the
fact that it goes to all the first nights," was his
reply.</p>

<p>Thereupon the interviewer suggested that
dramatic criticism was at least influential.</p>

<p>"Certainly; that is why it is so bad," he
replied, and went on to say:</p>

<p>"The moment criticism exercises any influence
it ceases to be criticism. The aim of the
true critic is to try and chronicle his own moods,
not to try and correct the masterpieces of others."</p>

<p>"Real critics would be charming in your eyes,
then?"</p>

<p>"Real critics? Ah, how perfectly charming
they would be! I am always waiting for their
arrival. An inaudible school would be nice.
Why do you not found it?"</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde was asked if there were, then,
absolutely no critics in London.</p>

<p>"There are just two," he answered, but refused
to give their names. The interviewer goes
on to recount his exact words:</p>

<p>"Mr Wilde, with the elaborate courtesy for
which he has always been famous, replied, 'I
think I had better not mention their names;
it might make the others so jealous.'</p>

<p>"'What do the literary cliques think of your
plays?'</p>

<p>"'I don't write to please cliques; I write to
please myself. Besides, I have always had grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
suspicions that the basis of all literary cliques is
a morbid love of meat-teas. That makes them
sadly uncivilised.'</p>

<p>"'Still, if your critics offend you, why don't
you reply to them?'</p>

<p>"'I have far too much time. But I think
some day I will give a general answer, in the
form of a lecture, in a public hall, which I shall
call "Straight Talks to Old Men."'</p>

<p>"'What is your feeling towards your audiences&mdash;towards
the public?'</p>

<p>"'Which public? There are as many publics
as there are personalities.'</p>

<p>"'Are you nervous on the night that you are
producing a new play?'</p>

<p>"'Oh no, I am exquisitely indifferent. My
nervousness ends at the last dress rehearsal; I
know then what effect my play, as presented
upon the stage, has produced upon me. My
interest in the play ends there, and I feel
curiously envious of the public&mdash;they have
such wonderful fresh emotions in store for
them.'</p>

<p>"I laughed, but Mr Wilde rebuked me with a
look of surprise.</p>

<p>"'It is the public, not the play, that I desire
to make a success,' he said.</p>

<p>"'But I'm afraid I don't quite understand&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'The public makes a success when it realises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
that a play is a work of art. On the three first
nights I have had in London the public has
been most successful, and had the dimensions
of the stage admitted of it, I would have called
them before the curtain. Most managers, I
believe, call them behind.'"</p>

<p>There are pages more of this sort of thing, and
the earlier and pretended interview in <i>Punch</i>
differs a little in period but very little in manner
from this real interview.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> continued its gibes during the whole
time of the first period. Really witty parodies
of Oscar Wilde's poems and plays appeared from
time to time. Pictures of him were drawn in
caricature by well-known artists. It was the
same in almost every society. The band of
enthusiasts listened to the message, but gave
more prominence to the poses and extravagances
which accompanied it. The message
was obscured and it was the fault of Oscar
Wilde's eccentricity.</p>

<p>We are reaping the benefit of it all now, at
present I am merely the chronicler of opinion
when the movement was in what the unobservant
thought was its heyday, but which has
proved to be its infancy.</p>

<p>The chorus of dislike and mistrust was almost
universal. At Oxford itself, popularly supposed
to be a stronghold of æstheticism at the time,

a debate on the question took place at the Union.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
A very prominent undergraduate of the day,
Mr J. A. Simon, of Wadham College, reflected
the bulk of Oxford opinion when he spoke as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr J. A. Simon (Wadham) said he felt
nervous, for it was an extraordinary occasion for
him to be on the side that would gain a majority.
He did not consider that the motion had at
all the meaning the mover gave it. He quite
agreed with him as to the advances made in
the illustrated press, and other things, and
that many of these selected changes were good.
The motion, however, evidently referred to the
movement headed by Oscar Wilde, and represented
by such things as the 'Yellow Book,' etc.
He always thought that the mover was most
natural when he was on the stage (applause)
and they had all been given pleasure by his impersonations
(applause). He believed, though,
that he had been acting that night, and the
speaker quoted from the speeches of Bassanio
passages which he considered described the way
the mover had led them off the scent. He
intended to discuss the matter seriously. As a
book entitled 'Degeneracy' pointed out, the
new movement was the outcome of a craving
for novelty, and the absurdities in connection
with it would do credit to a madhouse. People
were eccentric in the hope that they would be
taken to be original (applause). It was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
development at all; it was but a jerk or twitching,
the work of a moment. Oscar Wilde had
actually signed his name to a most awful pun,
as those who had seen 'The Importance Of
Being Earnest' would understand. The writer's
many epigrams were doubtless clever, for next
to pretending to be drunk, pretending to be
mad was the most difficult (applause). The
process was to turn a proverb upside down,
and there was the epigram. Then Aubrey
Beardsley's figures, if they showed anything,
showed extraordinary development; they certainly
were not delicate; in fact, he should call
them distinctly indelicate. For one thing, such
creatures never existed, and it was a species of
art that was absolutely imbecile. Oscar Wilde,
though, had said that until we see things as they
are not we never really live. But all he could
say was that he hoped he should never live
(applause). It was really not art at all, for art
was nearly allied to nature, although Oscar
Wilde said that the only connecting link was
a really well-made buttonhole. That sort of
thing was the art of being brilliantly absurd
(applause). It was insignificant to lay claim
to manners on the ground of personal appearance;
such were not manners but mannerisms.
Aubrey Beardsley's figures were but a mannerism
of this sort (applause). A development must
be new and permanent, and the pictures referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to were not new, for similar ones could be found
on the old Egyptian monuments (applause).
This cult were not even original individually, for
where one led all the rest followed. Oscar Wilde
talked about a purple sin: the others did the
same. By-the-by, that remark was not original,
for scarlet sins had been mentioned in very early
days; it was indeed all of it but a resuscitation of
what was old and had been long left behind by
the rest of the world (applause). The movement
was not permanent, as might be seen by the
æsthetic craze of fifteen years ago. Velvet coats
and peacock feathers were dying out, and soon
it would not be correct to wear the hair long
(laughter). It was but a phase; if everyone
were to talk in epigrams it would be distinguished
to talk sense. He was in a difficulty,
for if he got a large majority against the motion,
to be in a minority was just what would please
the æsthetes most. Therefore, let as few vote
against as possible (laughter). To be serious,
he considered that true art should give pleasure
and comfort to people who were in trouble or
down in the world, and who, he asked, would
be helped by the art of either Aubrey Beardsley
or Oscar Wilde? (applause). In conclusion, he
would ask the House to give the movers the
satisfaction of having as few as possible voting
for them (applause)."</p></blockquote>

<p>said a popular rhyme of the time. It sums up
average opinion and may fittingly close this
summary of it during the "Æsthetic" period.</p>

<p>We are forced to admit that the general misunderstanding
was partially due to the fashion
in which the new doctrines were presented. The
thing was well worth saying, but it was not said
seriously enough. It was a lamentable mistake,
but it helps us to understand a certain aspect of
Oscar Wilde: the man.</p>


<h3>THE SECOND PERIOD</h3>

<p>At the time in which what I have called the
"second period" may be said to have begun,
Wilde was emerging from the somewhat obscuring
influences of the Æsthetic movement and
was in a state of transition.</p>

<p>He was then editing a magazine known as
<i>The Woman's World</i>, and doing his work with
a conscientiousness and sense of responsibility
which shows us another side of him and one
which, to the sane, if limited, English temperament
is a singularly pleasant one. He had
moaned, money must be earned, and he earned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
it faithfully under a discipline. It is a speculation
not without interest when we wonder to
what heights such a man might not have risen if
a discipline such as this had been more continuous.</p>

<p>"Lord of himself, that heritage of woe," sang
Lord Byron, well aware from personal experience
of the constant dangers, the almost certain
shipwreck that the life of perfect freedom has for
such as he was, and for such a temperament as
Wilde's also.</p>

<p>Oscar was living in a beautiful house at Chelsea,
and it is a remarkable instance of how surely the
first period had merged into the second when
we find that the decorations of his home were
beautiful indeed, but not much like those he had
preached about and insisted on in his æsthetic
lectures and writings.</p>

<p>There was an utter lack of so-called æsthetic
colouring in the house where Mr and Mrs Wilde
had made their home. The scheme consisted,
indeed, of faded and delicate brocades, against a
background of white or cream painting, and was
French rather than English.</p>

<p>Rare engravings and etchings formed a deep
frieze along two sides of the drawing-room, and
stood out on a dull-gold background, while the
only touches of bright colour in the apartment
were lent by two splendid Japanese feathers let
into the ceiling, while, above the white, carved
mantelpiece, a gilt-copper bas-relief, by Donaghue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
made living Oscar Wilde's fine verses, "Requiescat."</p>

<p>Not the least interesting work of art in this
characteristic sitting-room was a quaint harmony
in greys and browns, purporting to be a portrait
of the master of the house as a youth; a painting
which was a wedding present from Mr Harper
Pennington, the American artist.</p>

<p>The house could boast of an exceptionally
choice gallery of contemporary art. Close to a
number of studies of Venice, presented by Mr
Whistler himself, hung an exquisite pen-and-ink
illustration by Walter Crane. An etching of
Bastien Le Page's portrait of Sarah Bernhardt
contained in the margin a few kindly words
written in English by the great tragedienne.</p>

<p>Mrs Oscar Wilde herself had strong ideas upon
house decoration. She once told an inquirer that
"no one who has not tried them knows the
value of uniform tints and a quiet scheme of
colouring. One of the most effective effects in
house decoration can be obtained by having, say,
the sitting-room pure cream or white, with,
perhaps, a dado of six or seven feet from the
ground. In an apartment of this kind, ample
colouring and variety will be introduced by the
furniture, engravings, and carpet; in fact, but
for the trouble of keeping white walls in London
clean, I do not think there can be anything
prettier and more practical than this mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
decoration, for it is both uncommon and easy to
carry out. I am not one of those," continued
Mrs Wilde, "who believe that beauty can only
be achieved at considerable cost. A cottage
parlour may be, and often is, more beautiful,
with its unconsciously achieved harmonies and
soft colouring, than a great reception-room,
arranged more with a view to producing a
magnificent effect. But I repeat, of late, people,
in their wish to decorate their homes, have
blended various periods, colourings and designs,
each perhaps beautiful in itself, but producing
an unfortunate effect when placed in juxtaposition.
I object also to historic schemes of
decoration, which nearly always make one think
of the upholsterer, and not of the owner of the
house."</p>

<p>In conjunction with her husband, Mrs Wilde
had also thought out the right place of flowers
in the decoration of a house. She would say:
"It is impossible to have too many flowers in a
room, and I think that scattering cut blossoms
on a tablecloth is both a foolish and a cruel
custom, for long before dinner is over the poor
things begin to look painfully parched and
thirsty for want of water. A few delicate
flowers in plain glass vases produce a prettier
effect than a great number of nosegays, and
yet, even though people may see that something
is wrong, many do not realise how easily a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
charming effect might be produced with the
same materials somewhat differently disposed.</p>

<p>"A Japanese native room, for example, is furnished
with dainty simplicity, and one flower
and one pot supply the Jap's æsthetic longing
for decoration. When he gets tired of his flower
and his pot, he puts them away, and seeks for
some other scheme of colour produced by equally
simple means."</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde now began to take a definite
place in the English social world. His wit, his
brilliance of conversation, his singular charm of
manner all combined to render him a welcome
guest, and in many cases a valued friend, in
circles where distinction of intellect and charm
of personality are the only passports. He began
to make money and to indulge a natural taste
for profusion and splendour. Yet, let it be said
here, and said with emphasis, that greatly as he
desired, and acquired, the elegances of life, increasing
fortune found him as kind and generous
as before. It is a known fact that he gave away
large sums of money to those less fortunate in
the effort to make an income by artistic pursuits.
His purse was always open to the struggling and
the unhappy and his influence constantly exerted
on their behalf.</p>

<p>Suddenly all London was captured by the
brilliant modern comedies he began to write.
Success of the completest kind had arrived, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
poet's name was in everyone's mouth. Curiously
enough it is the French students of Wilde's
career who have paid the most attention to
Wilde in this second period. The man of
society, the witty talker, the maker of epigrams&mdash;Wilde
at his apogee just before his fall&mdash;this
is the picture on which the Latin psychologists
have liked to dwell.</p>

<blockquote><p>"In our days, the master of repartee and the
after-dinner speaker is foredoomed to forgetfulness,
for he always stands alone, and to gain
applause has to talk down to and flatter lower-class
audiences. No writer of blood-curdling
melodramas, no weaver of newspaper novels is
obliged to lower his talent so much as the professional
wit. If the genius of Mallarmé was
obscured by the flatterers that surrounded him,
how much more was Wilde's talent overclouded
by the would-be-witty, shoddy-elegant, and
cheaply-poetical society hangers-on, who covered
him with incense. We are told that the first
attempts of the sparkling talker were by no
means successful in the Parisian salons.</p>

<p>"In the house of Victor Hugo, seeing he must
wait to let the veteran sleep out his nap whilst
others among the guests slumbered also, he made
up his mind to astonish them. He succeeded,
but at what a cost! Although he was a verse
writer, most sincerely devoted to poetry and art,
and one of the most emotional and sensitive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
tender-hearted amongst modern wielders of the
pen, he succeeded in gaining only a reputation
for artificiality.</p>

<p>"We all know his studied paradoxes, his five or
six continually repeated tales, but we are tempted
to forget the charming dreamer who was full of
tenderness for everything in nature."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus M. Charles Grolleau, and there is much
in his point of view. The writer of "The Happy
Prince" and "The House of Pomegranates" is
a different person from the paradoxical <i>causeur</i>
who went cometlike through a few London and
Paris seasons before disappearing into the darkness
of space.</p>

<p>And it was the encouragement and applause
bestowed upon Oscar Wilde during the second
period that not only confirmed him in his determination
to live as the complete <i>flaneur</i>, but
which prevented even sympathetic critics from
appreciating his work at its true worth.</p>

<p>The late M. Hugues Rebell, who knew him
fairly intimately, said of him:</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is true that Mallarmé has not written
much, but all he has done is valuable. Some
of his verses are most beautiful, whilst Wilde
seemed never to finish anything. The works of
the English æsthete are very interesting,
because they characterise his epoch; his pages
are useful from a documentary point of view,
but are not extraordinary from a literary standpoint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
In the 'Duchess of Padua,' he imitates
Hugo and Sardou; the 'Picture of Dorian
Gray' was inspired by Huysmans; 'Intentions'
is a <i>vade mecum</i> of symbolism, and all the ideas
contained therein are to be found in Mallarmé
and Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. As for Wilde's
poetry, it closely follows the lines laid down by
Swinburne. His most original composition is
'Poems in Prose.' They give a correct idea of
his home-chat, but not when he was at his best;
that, no doubt, is because the art of talking must
always be inferior to any form of literary composition.
Thoughts properly set forth in print
after due correction must always be more
charming than a finely sketched idea hurriedly
enunciated when conversing with a few disciples.
In ordinary table-talk we meet nothing more
than ghosts of new-born ideas foredoomed to
perish. The jokes of a wit seldom survive the
speaker. When we quote the epigrams of
Wilde, it is as if we were exhibiting in a glass
case a collection of beautiful butterflies, whose
wings have lost the brilliancy of their once
gaudy colours. Lively talk pleases, because of
the man who utters it, and we are impressed also
by the gestures which accompany his frothy discourse.
What remains of the sprightly quips
and anecdotes of such celebrated <i>hommes d'esprit</i>
as Scholl, Becque, Barbey d'Aurevilly! Some
stories of the eighteenth century have been transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to us by Chamfort, but only because he
carefully remodelled them by the aid of his
clever pen."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet during all the time of his success, when
he was receiving flattery enough, celebrity
enough, money enough to turn the head of a
far stronger-willed man than he was, there is
abundant evidence of a frequent aspiration after
better things. Serene and lofty moods came to
him now and again and found utterance in his
words or writings.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of his career he had
been in the public eye. Now he had, it seemed,
come into his own. The years of ridicule and
misrepresentation, the years of the first period,
were over and done with. A real and solid
popularity seemed to be his. Yet, just as he
had spoilt and obscured his æsthetic message by
those eccentricities which the Anglo-Saxon mind
will not permit in anyone who comes professing
to teach it, so now Oscar Wilde was to spoil the
triumphs of the second period by a mental
intoxication that led him step by step to ultimate
ruin and disgrace.</p>

<p>At this moment let us sum up the results at
which we have arrived in the study of this complex
character. We are all of us complex, but
Wilde was more strangely compounded than
the ordinary man in exact proportion as his
intelligence was greater and his power beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the general measure. This much and no more.</p>

<p>We have seen that the great fault of Wilde's
career up to this period was that of an unconquerable
egoism. He was complex only because
such mighty gifts as those with which he was
dowered were united to a temperament naturally
gracious, kindly, and that of a gentleman in the
best sense of the word, while both were obscured
by a self-appreciation and confidence which
reached not only the heights of absurdity but
surely impinged upon the borders of mental
failure. As he himself said over and over again
after his downfall, he had nobody but himself
to blame for it. Generous-hearted, free with all
material things, kind to the unfortunate, gentle
to the weak&mdash;Oscar Wilde was all these things.
Yet, at the same time, he committed the most
dreadful crimes against the social well-being;
without a thought of those his influence led into
terrible paths, without a thought of those nearest
and dearest to him, he deliberately imposed upon
them a horror and a shame with an extraordinary
and almost unparalleled callousness and hardness
of heart.</p>

<p>Bound up in the one man were the twin
natures of an angel of light and an angel of dark.
It is the same with all men, but never perhaps
in the history of the world, certainly never in
the history of literature, is there to be found a
contrast so astonishing. It is not for the writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of this study to hold the balance and to say
which part of his nature predominated. Opinion
about him is still divided into two camps, and
this book is a statement from which everyone
can draw his own conclusion, and does not
attempt to do more than provide the materials
for doing so. Yet, the explanation of it all,
if explanation there is, seems simple enough.
There was an extraordinary and abnormal divorce
between will-power and intelligence. Heavy
indulgence grew and grew and gradually obscured
the finer nature until he imagined his will
was supreme and his wishes the only law. The
royal intellect dominated the soul and grew by
what it fed on, until it unseated the reason, and
Wilde fell never to rise again, except only in his
work.</p>

<p>At the end of the second period came the
frightful exposure and scandals which sent the
author into prison. It is no part of this book to
touch upon these scandals or to do more than
breathe the kindly hope that Wilde was unconscious
of what he did, and was totally incapable
of realising its enormity.</p>

<p>The third period, in this attempt at chronicling
the various phases of his life and temperament,
might be said to have begun on the day
of his arrest, when his long agony and punishment
were to begin. Greatly as he deserved a
heavy punishment, not so much as for what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
did to himself but because of the corrupting
influence his life and association with others had
upon a large section of society, it is yet a moot
point whether he did not suffer for others and
was made their scapegoat. The true history of
this terrible period cannot be written and never
will be written. Yet, those who know it in its
entirety will say that Wilde bore the penalty for
the transgressions of many other people in addition
to the just punishment he received for his
own.</p>

<p>Few nobler things can be said of any man
than this. Let it be eternally placed to his
credit that he made no endeavour to lighten
his own punishment by implicating others. In
more than one instance the betrayal of a friend
would undoubtedly have lessened the cumulative
burden of the indictment brought against him.
He betrayed none of his friends.</p>


<h3>THE THIRD PERIOD</h3>

<p>This beautiful thread of brightness in the
dark warp and woof of Wilde's life at this
moment must not be forgotten by those who
would estimate his character. It is one of the
few relieving lights in the blackness with which
the third period opens. And yet, there is still
something that can be said for Wilde at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
time which certainly provides the student with
another aspect of him. It is the way in which
he met his fate and was prepared to endure his
punishment, although it would have been simple
for him to have avoided it. To avoid the consequences
of what he had done, inasmuch as the
ruin of his career is concerned, was, of course,
impossible. That, indeed, was to be the heaviest
part of his penalty. Yet, had he so chosen,
imprisonment and the frightful agony of the two
years need never have been his portion. A
French critic writing of him in the <i>Mercure
de France</i> takes an analytical view of this
fact, which I do not think is the true one,
though, nevertheless, it is interesting. He says:
"Neither his own heedlessness nor the envious
and hypocritical anger of his enemies, nor the
snobbish cruelty of social reprobation were the
true cause of his misfortunes. It was he himself
who, after a time of horrible anguish, consented
to his punishment, with a sort of supercilious
disdain for the weakness of human will, and out
of a certain regard and unhealthy curiosity for
the sportfulness of fate. Here was a voluptuary
seeking for torture and desiring pain after having
wallowed in every sensual pleasure. Can such
conduct have been due to aught else but sheer
madness?"</p>

<p>That is all very well, but it does not bear the
stamp of truth. It is an interesting point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
view and nothing more. The conduct of Wilde
when he at last came athwart the horror of his
destiny, when he realised what all the world
realised, that he must answer for his sins before
the public justice of England, was not unheroic,
nor without a fine and splendid dignity. At
this time I would much prefer to say, and all
the experiences of those around him confirm it,
that Wilde knew that it was his duty to himself
to endure what society was about to mete
out to him. To say that he was a mere gloomy
and jaded voluptuary who wished to taste the
pleasures of the most horrible and sordid pain, is
surely to talk something perilously like nonsense,
though full of one of those minute psychological
presumptions so dear to a certain type of Latin
mind.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that Oscar Wilde
refused to betray his friends, and in the light of
that fact, let us see whether his motive for
remaining in England to "face the music," as
his brother, William Wilde, expressed it, was
not something high and worthy in the midst of
this hideous wreck and bankruptcy of his fortune.
A friend who was with him then, his biographer,
and a man of position in English letters, said
that when the subject of flight was discussed, he
declared to Wilde that, in his opinion, it was the
best thing he could do, not only in his own
interests but in those of the public too. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
self-sacrificing friend offered to take all the
responsibility of the flight upon his own shoulders
and to make all the arrangements for it being
carried out.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that, at the time Wilde
was out on bail, and it has since been proved,
with as much certainty as anything of the sort
can be proved, that he was not watched by the
police, and that even between the periods of his
first and second trials, if he had secretly left the
country and sought a safe asylum on the Continent,
everybody would have felt relieved and the
public would have been spared a repetition of
the horrors which had already filled the pages
of the newspapers to repletion. After the collapse
of the action Oscar Wilde brought against
Lord Queensberry, he was allowed several hours
before the warrant for his arrest was executed in
order that he might leave the country. "But
imitative of great men in their whims and fancies,
he refused to imitate the base in acts which he
deemed cowardly. I do not think he ever
seriously considered the question of leaving the
country, and this, in spite of the fact that the
gentleman who was responsible for almost the
whole of the bail, had said, 'it will practically
ruin me if I lose all that money at the present
moment, but if there is a chance, even after conviction,
in God's name let him go.'"</p>

<p>Whatever Wilde's motive was for staying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
"face the music," we cannot deny that it was
fine. Either he felt that he must endure the
punishment society was to give him because he
had outraged the law of society, or else he was
unwilling to ruin the disinterested and noble-minded
man&mdash;a gentleman who had only the
slightest acquaintance with him&mdash;who had
furnished the amount of his bail.</p>

<p>Let these facts be written to his credit and
considered when the readers of this memoir pass
their judgment upon his character.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this third period public
opinion which, but a short time ago, had simply
meant a chorus of public adulation, except for
a minority of people who either envied his successes
or honestly reprobated his attitude towards
art and life, was now terribly bitter, venomous,
and full of spleen and hatred.</p>

<p>Society, however much society was disposed to
deny the fact, had set up an idol in their midst.
It was partly owing to the senseless and indiscriminate
adulation of its idol that its foundations
were undermined and that it fell with so resonant
a crash. When it was down society assailed it
with every ingenuity of reprobation and hatred
that it knew how to voice and use.</p>

<p>Nothing was too bad to be said about the
erstwhile favourite who, let it be remembered,
was not yet adjudged guilty but who, if ever a
man was, was denied the application of the prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
principle of English criminal law, which says that
every man accused is to be deemed innocent
until guilt has been proved against him. People
gloated over the downfall.</p>

<p>When Wilde was first arrested and placed in
Holloway, and before he was admitted to bail,
the more scurrilous portion of the press was full
of sickening pictures, both in line and words, of
the fallen creature's agony.</p>

<p>Contrasts were drawn by little pens dipped in
venom, and the writer of this memoir has in his
possession a curious and saddening collection of
the screeds of those days, a collection which shows
how innate the principle of cruelty is still in the
human mind despite centuries of civilisation and
the influence of the Cross, which forbids gladiators
to slay each other in the arena but allows a more
subtle and terrible form of savage sport than
anything that Nero or Caligula ever saw or
promulgated.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to quote largely from the
productions which disgraced the English press
at this time. One single article will serve to
prove the point. Let those who read it learn
tolerance from this mock sympathy and cruel
dwelling upon the tortures of one so recently
high in public popularity and esteem, still
presumably innocent by English law, and yet
placed under the vulgar microscope of the
morbid-minded and the lovers of sensation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
any cost.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Figuratively speaking but yesterday Oscar
Wilde was the man of the hour, and to him, and
him alone, we looked for our wit, our epigrams,
and our learned and interesting plays. But what
a change! To-day, Oscar Wilde, the wit, the
epicure, is gone from his world, and is languishing
in a dreary cell in Holloway Prison. In short,
Mr Wilde, in a moment of weak-headedness,
walked over the side of the mountain of fame
and fell headlong from its height to the morass
below, to lie there forgotten, neglected and
abused.</p>

<p>"Yes, although I have little or no sympathy
with Oscar Wilde I cannot but help feeling for
him in his altered circumstances. He is a man
who from his very infancy has been nursed in the
lap of luxury, and has systematically lived on the
fat of the land. Mr Wilde's residence in Tite
Street was elegantly and luxuriously furnished.
His rooms at the Cadogan Hotel were all that
comfort could desire. His room, or rather cell,
in Holloway Prison is altogether undesirable, is
badly furnished, ill-lighted, and uncomfortable.
Picture to yourself this change&mdash;yes, a change
effected within twenty-four hours&mdash;and then you
can imagine what the mental and physical sufferings
of a man of the Oscar Wilde temperament
must be. It is in this sense alone that my
sympathy goes out towards him, and I feel as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
man for another man who has been suddenly
snatched from the lap of indolent, free livelihood
and suddenly pitched foremost into the icelike
crevasse of a British prison cell.</p>

<p>"I will now describe in as few words as I possibly
can, but with absolute accuracy and detail, the
cell in which Mr Wilde spends his time and the
manner in which he lives. The cell in which
Oscar is incarcerated is not an ordinary one&mdash;that
is, it is not one that is used by any condemned
or ordinary prisoner under remand. The cell is
known in prison <i>parlance</i> as a 'special cell,' for
the use of which a fee is payable to the authorities,
and is the same one as was occupied by a certain
well-known Duchess some few months back when
she was committed by the Queen's Bench Judges
for contempt of court. The prison authorities
only supply the 'cell,' the prisoner himself has
to find his own furniture, which he usually hires,
by the advice of one of the warders, from a local
firm who have a suite they keep for the use of
this 'special cell' in Holloway. When Mr
Wilde arrived at the prison last Saturday week
afternoon this 'cell' was vacant. He promptly
gave orders for the furniture to be brought in,
and in an incredibly short space of time the cell
was furnished, and the distinguished prisoner
took possession of his apartment. I will first
describe the room, and then take one typical day
in the prison routine, which will clearly show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the kind of life that Mr Wilde is compelled to
live.</p>

<p>"Now to the cell. The room is situated at
the far end of the east wing of the prison, and is
entered from the long passage which runs from
the head warder's rooms past the convict cells,
and terminates at the door which protects Oscar
from the common herd, and helps to make him
secure. The door is an ordinary prison cell door,
possessing spyholes and flaptrap, and large iron
bars and locks. The cell itself is about 10 ft. broad,
12 ft. long, and 11 ft. high. The walls are not
papered but whitewashed, and the light by which
the room is supplied is obtained through an iron-barred
window in the wall placed high up and
well out of the prisoner's reach. A small fireplace
is also fixed securely at the end of the room,
but it is seldom lit, as the room is well heated
by hot-water pipes. Now to the furniture in the
room. Just on the right-hand side of the window
is placed a table made of hard, white wood. No
cloth covers it, but at the back is placed a looking-glass,
whilst on the table itself is a water jug and
a Bible. Near the table and almost under the
window is an arm-chair, in which Oscar spends
most of his time. But more of this anon. In
the corner near the fireplace is placed a small
camp bedstead, which is so small that it seems
almost an impossibility that so massive a form as
that of Oscar could recline with any ease upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
so small a space. No feather bed is upon the
iron supports, and the sleeper is compelled to
repose upon hard&mdash;probably too hard&mdash;mattresses.
The bed is supplied with sheets, blankets,
and a cover quilt, made up of patches of all
colours of the rainbow. This quilt is not pretty,
and most considerably upsets the artistic being
of a man like Wilde. A small table on the
other side of the room, another chair, and a small
metal washing stand, go to make up all the
furniture the room possesses. No carpet is on
the floor, but the boards are kept scrupulously
clean. This I think briefly comprises a description
of Mr Wilde's residential and sleeping compartment.
Now to his daily routine and the
life he is compelled to lead. He is awakened by
a warder at six o'clock, and whether he likes it
or not, is compelled to get up. After washing
himself in cold water&mdash;hot is not permitted&mdash;and
using ordinary common soap, Mr Wilde dresses
himself, and to do him justice, he turns himself
out very neat and span considering he has no
valet to wait upon him. At seven o'clock one
of the convicted prisoners enters Mr Wilde's cell,
cleans up the room, makes the bed, and generally
tidies up the place. For this service the prisoner
receives 1s. per week, and it usually takes him
quite half-an-hour per day to get through his
work. Truly a munificent remuneration, but
then prison regulations, whenever reasonable, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
on the side of liberality. At half-past seven
o'clock Wilde's breakfast, usually consisting of
tea, ham and eggs, or a chop, toast and bread and
butter, arrives from a well-known restaurant in
Holloway. Of course Mr Wilde pays for the
food, and, within reason, can eat and drink what
he pleases.</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock Mr Wilde is compelled to
leave his cell, and proceed to the exercising
yard of the prison, and for one hour he is compelled
to walk at regulation pace round a kind
of tower erected in the centre of the yard.
After exercise the distinguished prisoner returns
to his cell, and the daily newspapers are brought
to him, for which he also pays. Mr Wilde sits
during the time he is in his cell in the chair
by the window, and then reads his papers. He,
however, has moments of very low-spiritedness,
and becomes almost despondent in the moods.
The sketch in this issue represents him seated in
his favourite chair, with a paper in his hand, and,
after an interview with his solicitor, Mr Wilde is
very fond, when his active brain is working too
deeply, to push back his hair from off his forehead
and then leave the hand on the head, and,
as if staring into vacancy, sit for hours in this
position thinking deeply. But, to continue, at
twelve o'clock Mr Wilde's lunch arrives from
the restaurant, for which he pays. It consists
of a cut off the joint, vegetables, cheese, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
biscuits and water, or one glass of wine. After
lunch he is again taken to the exercise ground
for an hour, and then sent back to his cell.
Still seated in his chair, he still reads his papers,
and thinks out improbable problems. Sometimes
one of his friends comes to see him. On
these occasions he brightens up, but after the
visits of his solicitor he is visibly very low-spirited
and morose. At six o'clock Mr Wilde's
dinner&mdash;for which he pays&mdash;arrives. It consists
usually of soup, fish, joint, or game, cheese, and
half-a-pint of any wine he chooses to select.
The dinner finished, Mr Wilde sits again in his
chair, and the agony he endures at not being
allowed even a whiff at his favourite cigarette
must to him be agony indeed. At eight o'clock
a warder enters his room and places a lamp on
the table to light the room. At nine o'clock
the same warder again enters the room and gives
Oscar five minutes to undress himself and get
into bed. He complies willingly but with a
sigh. When he is safely in bed the warder
removes the lamp, bolts and locks the door,
and leaves Oscar to sleep or remain awake thinking,
just as he pleases. Oscar, however, does not
sleep much. He is out of bed most of the night,
and in unstockinged feet paces the room in
apparently not too good a mood. Yes, poor
Oscar, I do pity you."</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for popular kindness!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The trial, at which the accused man was admitted
by everyone to have comported himself
with a dignity and resignation that had nothing
of that levity and occasional pose which must be
allowed to have characterised his attitude during
the two former ordeals, came to a close. Wilde
was sentenced to prison for two years' hard
labour.</p>

<p>During the trial, of course, no comment was
permissible, though there were not wanting
some papers who committed contempt of court.
When, however, the sentence had been pronounced
and Wilde as a man with a place in
society&mdash;I am using the word society here not
in its limited but its economic sense&mdash;had ceased
to exist, then the thunders of the important and
influential journals were let loose.</p>

<p><i>The Daily Telegraph</i> which, to do it justice,
had never been sympathetic to Wilde in his
days of prosperity and fame, came out with a
most weighty and severe condemnation. The
article, from which I am about to quote an
extract, certainly represented the opinion of the
country at the time&mdash;as <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> has
nearly always represented the mass of opinion
of the country at any given moment. To
the sympathisers with Wilde this article will
seem unnecessarily cruel and severe. But to
those who have taken into account the best that
has been written herein about him during this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
terrible third period, and who have realised that
the writer simply states facts and does not desire
to comment on them, the article will seem only
a natural and dignified expression of a truth
which was hardly controvertible.</p>

<blockquote><p>"No sterner rebuke could well have been
inflicted on some of the artistic tendencies of
the time than the condemnation on Saturday of
Oscar Wilde at the Central Criminal Court.
We have not the slightest intention of reviewing
once more all the sordid incidents of a case
which has done enough, and more than enough,
to shock the conscience and outrage the moral
instincts of the community. The man has now
suffered the penalties of his career, and may
well be allowed to pass from that platform of
publicity which he loved into that limbo of disrepute
and forgetfulness which is his due. The
grave of contemptuous oblivion may rest on
his foolish ostentation, his empty paradoxes,
his insufferable posturing, his incurable vanity.
Nevertheless, when we remember that he enjoyed
a certain popularity among some sections
of society, and, above all, when we reflect that
what was smiled at as insolent braggadocio was
the cover for, or at all events ended in, flagrant
immorality, it is well, perhaps, that the lesson of
his life should not be passed over without some
insistence on the terrible warning of his fate.
Young men at the universities, clever sixth-form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
boys at public schools, silly women who lend an
ear to any chatter which is petulant and vivacious,
novelists who have sought to imitate the
style of paradox and unreality, poets who have
lisped the language of nerveless and effeminate
libertinage&mdash;these are the persons who should
ponder with themselves the doctrines and the
career of the man who has now to undergo the
righteous sentence of the law. We speak sometimes
of a school of Decadents and Æsthetes
in England, although it may well be doubted
whether at any time its prominent members
could not have been counted on the fingers of
one hand; but, quite apart from any fixed
organisation or body such as may or may not
exist in Paris, there has lately shown itself in
London a contemporary bias of thought, an
affected manner of expression and style, and
a few loudly vaunted ideas which have had a
limited but evil influence on all the better
tendencies of art and literature. Of these the
prisoner of Saturday constituted himself a representative.
He set an example, so far as in him
lay, to the weaker and the younger brethren;
and, just because he possessed considerable intellectual
powers and unbounded assurance, his
fugitive success served to dazzle and bewilder
those who had neither experience nor knowledge
of the principles which he travestied, or of that
true temple of art of which he was so unworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
an acolyte. Let us hope that his removal will
serve to clear the poisoned air, and make it
cleaner and purer for all healthy and unvitiated
lungs."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the duty of a great journal to say what
it said. Yet, nevertheless, a certain wave of
sorrow seemed to pass over the press generally,
and hostile comment on the <i>débâcle</i> was not
unmingled with regret for the unhappy man
himself. The doctrines he was supposed to have
preached to the world at large were sternly denied
and thundered against. His own fate was, in
the majority of cases, treated with a sorrowful
regret.</p>

<p>Yet, nobody realised at all that in condemning
what was supposed to be the teaching and
doctrine of Oscar Wilde, they were condemning
merely supposititious deduction from his manner
of life, which could not be in the least substantiated
by any single line he had ever written.</p>

<p>All through this first part of the book I have
insisted upon the fact that the man's life and the
man's work should not be regarded as identical.
To-day, as I write, that attitude has taken complete
possession of the public mind. As was
said in the first few pages of the memoir, the
whole of Europe is taking a sympathetic and
intelligent interest in the supreme art of the
genius who produced so many beautiful things.
The public seems to have learned its lesson at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
last, but at the beginning of what I have called
the third period it was unable to differentiate
between the criminal, part of whose life was
shameful, and the artist, all of whose works
were pure, stimulating, and splendid. I quote
but a few words from the printed comments
upon Wilde's downfall. They are taken from
the well-known society paper <i>Truth</i>, and the
writer seems to strike only a note of wonder
and amazement. The horrible fact of Wilde's
conviction had startled England, had startled
the writer, and a writer by no means unsympathetic
in effect, into the following paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"For myself, I turned into the Lyceum for
half-an-hour, just to listen, when the performance
was actually stopped by the great shout of congratulation
that welcomed the first entrance of
'Sir Henry.' Yet, through all these cheers I
seemed to hear the dull rumble of the prison van
in which Oscar Wilde made his last exit&mdash;to
Holloway. While the great actor-manager stood
in the plenitude of position bowing and bowing
again, to countless friends and admirers, again
there rose before my eyes the last ghastly scene
at the Old Bailey&mdash;I heard the voice of the
foreman in its low but steady answer, 'Guilty,'
'Guilty,' 'Guilty,' as count after count was
rehearsed by the clerk. I heard again that last
awful admonition from the judge. I remembered
how there had flitted through my mind the recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of a night at St James's, the cigarette,
and the green carnation, as the prisoner, broken,
beaten, tottering, tried to steady himself against
the dock rail and asked in a strange, dry, ghostlike
voice if he might address the judge. Then
came the volley of hisses, the prison warders, the
rapid break-up of the Court, the hurry into the
blinding sunshine outside, where some half-score
garishly dressed, loose women of the town danced
on the pavement a kind of carmagnole of rejoicing
at the verdict. 'He'll 'ave 'is 'air cut regglar
<i>now</i>,' says one of them; and the others laughed
stridently. I came away. I did not laugh, for
the matter is much too serious for laughter.</p>

<p>"The more I think about the case of Oscar
Wilde, my dear Dick, the more astounding does
the whole thing seem to me. So far as the man
himself is concerned, it would be charitable to
assume that he is not quite sane. Without considering&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;the moral aspect of
the matter, here was a man who must have known
that the commission of certain acts constituted
in the eye of the Law a criminal offence. But
no thought of wife or children, no regard, to put
it selfishly, for his own brilliant prospects, could
induce him to curb a depraved appetite which
led him&mdash;a gentleman and a scholar&mdash;to consort
with the vilest and most depraved scum of the
town."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although, as I have said, printed comment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
was in one way reserved and not ungenerous,
the public and spoken comment on the case was
utterly and totally cruel. Those readers who
remember the period of which I am writing will
bear me witness as to the universal chorus of
hatred which rose and bubbled all over the
country.</p>

<p>This was natural enough.</p>

<p>One cannot expect mob law to be tolerant or
to understand the myriad issues and influences
which go to make up any given event. The
public was right from its own point of view in
all it said. To give instances from personal recollection
or the personal recollection of others of
this terrible shout of condemnation and hatred
would be too painful for writer and reader alike.</p>

<p>While in prison Oscar Wilde wrote his marvellous
book "De Profundis." The reader will
find that work very fully dealt with in its due
place in this work. It is not, therefore, necessary
to say very much about it in this first part of the
volume which I have headed "Oscar Wilde:
the Man." It may not be out of place, however,
to say that grave doubts were thrown upon the
truth of the statement that the book was written
in prison. Upon its publication rumours were
circulated that the author wrote "De Profundis"
at his ease in Paris or in Naples, and finally the
rumours crystallised in a letter which was sent
to <i>The St James's Gazette</i>, the gist of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have very strong doubts that it was written
in prison, and the gentleman who asserts that he
received the MSS. before the expiration of the
sentence in Reading Gaol ought to procure a
confirmatory testimony to a proceeding which is
contrary to all prison discipline. If there is one
thing more strictly carried out than another it is
that a prisoner shall not be allowed to handle
pen, ink, and paper, except when he writes the
letter to his friends, which, until the Prison Act,
1899, was once every three months. Each
prisoner can amuse himself with a slate and
pencil, but not pen and ink. It is now, and was,
absolutely forbidden by the prison authorities.</p>

<p>"As was seen in Adolf Beck's case, where nine
petitions appear in the Commissioner's Report
(Blue Book), a prisoner's liberty, fortune, reputation,
and life may be at stake, but he must tell
his story on two and a half sheets of foolscap.
Not a scrap of paper is allowed over the regulation
sheets. In a local prison Oscar Wilde could
apply for the privilege of a special visit or a
letter, and probably would receive it, but as the
official visitors of prisoners are simply parts of a
solemn farce, and there is no such stereotyped
method as giving a prisoner the slightest relief
in matters affecting the intellect, I have grave
doubts that such facilities were given as supplying
pen, ink and paper to write 'De Profundis.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it was otherwise the following process
would have had to be gone through, either an
application to the official prison visitor (possibly
Major Arthur Griffiths) for leave to have pen,
ink and paper in his cell, which would be refused.
By the influence of friends, or the statement of
his solicitors that they required special instructions
in reference to some evidence, his case,
or his property, leave might be granted, but not
for journalistic or literary purposes. Had Oscar
Wilde's sentence been that of a 'first-class misdemeanant'
he could have had those privileges,
but I never heard that his sentence was mitigated
in this respect.</p>

<p>"Or, he might have applied to the visiting
magistrates. In either case there would be a
record of such facilities, and the Governor of
Reading Gaol, the chaplain, and other officials
can satisfy the public as well as the Prison Commissioners.
If the book was written in prison
then it is clear the officials made a distinction
between Oscar Wilde and other prisoners.</p>

<p>"There is some glamour about books written
in prisons. The 'Pilgrim's Progress' is a prison
book, but Bedford Gaol was a pretty easy
dungeon. Under the old <i>régime</i> such men as
William Corbett, Orator Hunt, and Richard
Carlile, conducted their polemic warfare in prison.
The last Chartist leader (the late Mr Ernest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Jones) used to tell how he wrote the 'Painter of
Florence' and other poems in a London gaol
while confined for sedition. It was a common
subject of conversation with his young disciples
how, as ink was denied in Coldbath Street Prison,
he made incisions in his arm and wrote his
poetry in his own blood. We believed it then,
but as we grew older that feeling of doubt made
us sceptical. Thomas Cooper's prison rhyme,
the 'Purgatory of Suicides,' and his novel, the
'Baron's Yule Feast,' were written during his
two years' imprisonment in Stafford Gaol for
preaching a 'universal strike' as a means of
establishing a British Republic.</p>

<p>"As 'De Profundis' is likely to be a classic,
is it not as well to have this question thrashed
out at the beginning and not leave it to the
twenty-first century?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The editor of "De Profundis" replied in a
short letter saying, in effect, that he was not
concerned to add anything to his definite statement
in the preface of the book, a course with
which everyone will be in agreement. To
answer a busybody throwing doubts upon the
statement of an honourable gentleman is a
mistake. The matter, however, went a little
further and was eventually set finally at rest.</p>

<p>In <i>The Daily Mirror</i> a facsimile of a page
of the manuscript written on prison paper was
reproduced, and Mr Hamilton Fyfe accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the letterpress by informing the public that he
had seen the whole of the manuscript of "De
Profundis." It was written on blue foolscap
paper with the prison stamp on the top. There
were about 60,000 words, of which altogether
not more than one-third were published in the
English edition. The explanation of the fact
that the prisoner was allowed to write in his cell
is perfectly simple.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde handed this roll of paper to Mr
Robert Ross on the day of his release, and gave
him absolute discretion as to printing it. He
had written most of it during the last three
months of his two years' sentence. It was
during the last half-year of his term that Wilde
was allowed the special privilege of writing as
much as he pleased. His friends represented
to the Home Office that a man who had been
accustomed to use his brain so continually was
in danger of having his mind injured by being
unable to write for so long a time as two years.</p>

<p>Dr Nicholson, of Broadmoor, who was consulted
on the point, said he thought this danger
was quite a real one. So the necessary permission
was given, and Wilde could write
whatever he liked.</p>

<p>Later on the prison regulations were relaxed
again. As a rule, prisoners are not allowed to
take away with them what they have written in
their cells. Strictly, the MS. of "De Profundis"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
ought to have remained among the archives of
Reading Gaol.</p>

<p>The authorities realised, however, that to enforce
this rule in Wilde's case would have been
harsh and unreasonable, so when (in order to
defeat the intentions of the late Lord Queensberry
and his hired bullies) he was removed
from Reading to Wandsworth Prison, on the
evening before his release he took the MS. with
him; and he had it under his arm when he left
the gloomy place next morning a free man.</p>

<p>This statement, and the facsimile printed
above, should make it impossible henceforward
for anyone to suggest, as many have been
suggesting quite recently, that there is any
doubt about the whole of the book having
been written by Oscar Wilde during the time
he was in prison.</p>

<p>The development of Oscar Wilde during his
incarceration has, of course, been summed up
and stated for all time by himself in the marvellous
pages of "De Profundis." Yet, there
are various accounts of that time of agony which
do but go to show what a really purifying and
salutary influence even the awful torture he
underwent had upon the unhappy man. By
those who knew him in prison he is described as
living a life which, in its simple resignation, its
kindly gentleness, its sweetness of demeanour,
was the life of a saint. No bitterness or harsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
word ever escaped him. When opportunity occurred
of doing some tiny and furtive kindness
that kindness was always forthcoming. Those
who rejoiced at the fact of Wilde's imprisonment
may well pause now when the true story
of it has filtered through various channels and
is generally known. He himself told Monsieur
André Gide a strange and pathetic story of
those silent, unhappy hours.</p>

<p>He speaks of one of the Governors under
whose rule he lay in durance, and says that this
gentleman imposed needless suffering upon his
unhappy charges, not because of any inherent
cruelty or contravention of the rules for prison
discipline, but because he was entirely lacking
in imagination.</p>

<p>On one occasion, during the hour allowed for
exercise, a prisoner who walked behind Wilde
upon the circular pathway of the yard addressed
him by name, and told him that he pitied him
even more than he pitied himself, because his
sufferings must be greater than his. Such a
sudden word of sympathy from an unknown
fellow-convict gave the poor poet an exquisite
moment of pleasure and pain. He answered him
appropriately with a word of thanks. But one
of the warders had been a witness of the occasion,
and the matter was reported to the Governor.
Two convicts had been guilty of the outrage of
exchanging a few words. The unknown convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was taken first before the Governor. It is a
prison regulation that the punishment is not the
same for the man who speaks first and the man
who answers him. The first offender has to pay
a double penalty. The Convict X., when before
the Governor, stated that he was the culprit and
that he had spoken first. When afterwards
Wilde was taken before the martinet, he very
naturally told him that he himself was the
principal offender. The Governor stated that
he was unable to understand the matter at all.
He grew red and uneasy, and told Wilde that
he had already given X. fifteen days' solitary confinement.
He then stated that as Wilde had
also confessed to be the principal offender he
should award him fifteen days' solitary confinement
also!</p>

<p>This touching incident shows both Wilde and
the unknown convict in a noble light, but the
gentle way in which Oscar told of the incident
to the French journalist is even a greater tribute
to the innate dignity of his character, so long
obscured by the exigencies of his life, so beautifully
laid bare when he had paid his debt to
society.</p>

<p>There are other anecdotes extant which confirm
the above. All go to show that the third
period brought out the finest traits in Wilde's
character. We have in this period another and
most touching side of the complex temperament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of this great genius, this extraordinary and unhappy
man. Much will have to be said on this
point when the criticism of "De Profundis" is
reached.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I close the "third period" with
a sense that here, at anyrate, there is nothing to
be said which is not wholly fragrant and redolent
of sincerity.</p>


<h3>THE FOURTH PERIOD</h3>

<p>It is with a sense of both reluctance and relief
that I enter upon a short account of the fourth
period, insomuch as this or that incident during
it throws a light upon the character of him of
whom we speak.</p>

<p>With a relief, because it is a far happier and
more gracious task to endeavour to criticise and
appreciate the literary works of a great genius
than it is to chronicle facts in the life of a most
unhappy man which may help to elucidate the
puzzle of his personality.</p>

<p>With reluctance, because the fourth period is
again one of almost unadulterated gloom and
sadness. I shall be as brief as possible, and too
much already has been written about the last
days of Oscar Wilde after his release from prison.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of information has
been placed at my disposal, but I design to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
none of it. The facts that are already known to
those who have taken an interest in Oscar Wilde
may be briefly touched upon here, and that is
all. An eloquent plea from a near relation of
the poet should be respected here, and only such
few facts as are really necessary to complete this
incomplete study shall be given. "Nothing
could have horrified him more than that men
calling themselves his friends should publish
concerning his latter days details so disgusting
as those appearing in your issue of yesterday."
Thus a paragraph from the appeal I have
mentioned, an appeal which was prompted by
the publication of many controversial articles
as to the truth, or otherwise, of Mr Wilde's reception
into the Roman Church, his debts, his
manner of living towards the end. "I should be
glad to think that this expression of my wish
may put an end to this unpleasant correspondence.
If it does not, I can only appeal to your
correspondents to be very careful of what they
write, and to reflect upon what Mr Oscar Wilde
would think if he could read their letters. In
life, he never said or countenanced a coarse or
common thing. Personally, I write with too
much reluctance to reply to them again, and I
leave the matter to their sense of decency and
chivalry."</p>

<p>Immediately upon his release from prison
Oscar Wilde wrote his famous letters to <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Daily Chronicle</i> on "Children in Prison and
Other Cruelties of Life in Gaol." He told a
terrible story of a poor little child whose face
was "like a white wedge of sheer terror," and in
his eyes "the mute appeal of a hunted animal."
Wilde had heard the poor little fellow at breakfast-time
crying and calling to be let out. He
was calling for his parents, and every now and
then the elder prisoner could hear the harsh
voice of the warder on duty telling the little boy
to be quiet. The child had not been convicted
of the offence with which he was charged, but
was simply on remand. A kind-hearted warder,
finding the little fellow crying with hunger and
utterly unable to eat the bread and water given
it for breakfast, brought it some sweet biscuits.
This, Mr Wilde truthfully said, was a "beautiful
action on the warder's part." The child, grateful
for the man's kindness, told one of the senior
warders about it. The result was that the
warder who had brought the biscuits to the
starving child was reported and dismissed from
the service.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that this story, told
in the prose of a master of prose, written with a
crushing and sledgehammer force all the more
powerful because it was most marvellously
simple, thrilled the whole of England. There
followed an even more terrible story.</p>

<p>Three months or so before his release, Wilde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
had noticed, among the prisoners who took
exercise with him, a young prisoner who was
obviously either half-witted or trembling upon
the verge of insanity. This poor creature used
to gesticulate, laugh and talk to himself. "At
chapel he used to sit right under the observation
of two warders, who carefully watched him all
the time. Sometimes he would bury his head in
his hands, an offence against the chapel regulations,
and his head would be immediately struck
up by a warder.... He was on more than
one occasion sent out of chapel to his cell, and
of course he was continually punished.... I
saw that he was becoming insane and was being
treated as if he were shamming." There was a
terrible denouement to this hideous story. Mr
Wilde went on to say in words that do him
eternal credit and which no one who has read
them could ever forget:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On Saturday week last, I was in my cell
at about one o'clock occupied in cleaning and
polishing the tins I had been using for dinner.
Suddenly I was startled by the prison silence
being broken by the most horrible and revolting
shrieks, or rather howls, for at first I thought
some animal like a bull or a cow was being unskilfully
slaughtered outside the prison walls. I
soon realised, however, that the howls proceeded
from the basement of the prison, and I knew
that some wretched man was being flogged. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
need not say how hideous and terrible it was for
me, and I began to wonder who it was being
punished in this revolting manner. Suddenly it
dawned upon me that they might be flogging
this unfortunate lunatic. My feelings on the
subject need not be chronicled; they have nothing
to do with the question.</p>

<p>"The next day, Sunday, I saw the poor fellow
at exercise, his weak, ugly, wretched face bloated
by tears and hysteria almost beyond recognition.
He walked in the centre ring along with the old
men, the beggars and the lame people, so that I
was able to observe him the whole time. It was
my last Sunday in prison, a perfectly lovely day,
the finest day we had had the whole year, and
there, in the beautiful sunlight, walked this poor
creature&mdash;made once in the image of God&mdash;grinning
like an ape, and making with his hands
the most fantastic gestures."</p></blockquote>

<p>The story continued with even more terrible
details than these. It is no part of my plan to
harrow the feelings of my readers by a reprint
of such horrors. I have said enough, I trust,
to fulfil my purpose in quoting Oscar Wilde's
letters to all&mdash;to show how powerfully he himself
was moved with pity, and how he strove,
even in his own terrible re-entrance to a world
which would have none of him, to influence
public opinion on the behalf of one who was
being done to death, not perhaps by conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
cruelty, but by the awful stupidity of those who
live by an inflexible rule which can make no
allowance for special circumstances, which is as
hard as the nether millstone and as cold as
death itself.</p>

<p>So Oscar Wilde passed out of England with
pity flowing from his pen and with pity in his
heart. I wish that it was possible to end this
memoir here. As I have set out to give all the
facts which seem necessary to provide a complete
picture for readers who know little or nothing
of Oscar Wilde's nature, beyond the fact of his
triumphs as a playwright and his subsequent
disgrace, I must not shrink from proceeding to
the end, as I have not shrunk from frankly
recording facts in the first and second periods.
It would be a fault, and insincere, to allow a
deep and very natural sympathy to interfere with
the performance, however inadequately it has
been carried out, of the task I set out to
complete.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde crossed immediately to Dieppe,
and shortly afterwards installed himself in a
villa at a small seaside place some miles away
from the gay Norman bathing place. His life at
Berneval was simple and happy. His biographer,
Mr Robert Harborough Sherard, who visited
him there, has told of the quiet repose and healing
days which Oscar Wilde enjoyed. He had
a sufficient sum of money to live in comfort for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a year or so, and all would doubtless have gone
well with him had it not been for certain malign
influences which had already been prominent
factors in wrecking his life, and which now
appeared again to menace his newly found salvation
of mind and spirit. Such references are not
within the province of the book, the story has
been told elsewhere. The thing would not have
been referred to at all, did it not illustrate the
impatience and weakness of Wilde's character,
even at this point in his history. The malign
influences eventually had their way with the
poet&mdash;that is to say, certain companions whom
it was most unwise of him to see or recognise,
once more entered into his life in a certain
degree.</p>

<p>A letter which was written to a gentleman
who has translated a French memoir dealing
with the poet, says: "No more beautiful life
has any man lived, no more beautiful life could
any man live than Oscar Wilde lived during the
short period I knew him in prison. He wore
upon his face an eternal smile; sunshine was on
his face, sunshine of some sort must have been
in his heart. People say he was not sincere: he
was the very soul of sincerity when I knew him.
If he did not continue that life after he left
prison, then the forces of evil must have been
too strong for him. But he tried, he honestly
tried, and in prison he succeeded." The forces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
evil were too strong.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde spent the last few years, and
alas! miserable years, of his life in alternations of
sordid poverty and sudden waves of temporary
prosperity, in the city of Paris. There have been
all sorts of stories about these last few years.
The truth is simply this. Wilde's intellect was
crushed and broken. The creative faculty flamed
up for the last time in that brilliant and terrible
poem, "The Ballad of Reading Gaol." Then it
sank again and was never revived. When I say
"creative faculty" I mean the faculty of producing
a sustained artistic effort. As a talker
the poet was never more brilliant. "Every now
and again one or other of the very few faithful
English friends left to him would turn up in
Paris and take him to dinner at one of the best
restaurants, and anyone who met him on these
occasions would have found it difficult to believe
that he had ever passed through such awful
experiences. Whether he was expounding some
theory, grave or fantastic, embroidering it the
while with flashes of impromptu wit, or deepening
it with extraordinary intimate learning, or
whether he was keeping the table in a roar with
his delightfully whimsical humour, a summer
lightning that flashed and hurt no one, he was
equally admirable. To have lived in his lifetime
and not to have heard him talk is as though
one had lived at Athens without going to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
at the Parthenon."</p>

<p>I think we should be glad to know that in the
wrecked life of this period the poet had some
happy moments when he could reconstruct in
bright and brilliant surroundings some slight
renewal of other days that were gone for ever.
There is no doubt at all that friends, both those
who had had a good and those who had had
a bad influence on his past life, were very kind
to him.</p>

<p>He was supplied with enough money to have
lived in considerable comfort had he not been
incurably reckless and a spendthrift. It has
been said that he died in wretched poverty and
in debt. This is partly true, but it was entirely
his own fault. There is indubitable proof of the
fairly large sums he received from time to time.
Some of his letters to a man in London, who
occasionally employed his pen, have been sold to
the curious, and such poignant passages as: "I
rely on your sending me a little money to-morrow.
I have only succeeded in getting twenty francs
from the Concierge, and I am in a bad way," or,
"I wish to goodness you could come over, also&mdash;send
me, if you can, £4 or even £3. I am now
trying to leave my hotel and get rooms where
I can be at rest, and so stay in during the
morning."</p>

<p>These letters seem to show that Oscar Wilde
was nearly starving. I can assure my readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
this was not the case. With the realisation that
there would never be any more place for him in
the world had come a carelessness and recklessness
to all but immediate and petty sensual
gratifications from day to day.</p>

<p>His landlord stated that towards the end it
became very difficult for Wilde to write at all.
"He used to whip himself up with cognac. A
litre bottle would hardly see him through the
night. And he ate little. And he took little
exercise. He used to sleep till noon, and then
breakfast, and then sleep again till five or six
in the evening."</p>

<p>This is enough. I have said as little as can
well be said. But let us remember the frightful
and crushing disabilities under which Wilde
suffered. Who is there who dare cast a stone?
His death came as a happy release, and it was
sordid and dreadful enough to complete the grim
tragedy of his life without deviation from its
completeness. True, an attached friend was
by him at the end. True, the offices of the
Holy Catholic Church lightened his passing.
Yet, nevertheless, there was an abiding and
sinister gloom about all his last hours. Details
can be found in other places. "How Oscar
Wilde died" was a journalistic sensation at the
time.</p>

<p>I will simply quote the words of a French
critic, who, after the end, went to pay his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sad duties to the shell which had held the poet's
soul: "... The hotel in which he died was one
of those horrible places which are called in the
popular papers 'Houses of Crime.' A veritable
Hercules of a porter led me through a long, evil-smelling
corridor. At last the odour of some
disinfectant struck my nostrils. An open door.
A little square room. I stood before the corpse.
His whitish, emaciated face, strangely altered
through the growth of a beard after death, seemed
to be lost in profound contemplation. A hand,
cramped in agony, still clutched the dirty bed
cloth. There was no one to watch by his body.
Only much later they sent him some flowers.
The noise of the street pierced the thin walls of
the building. A stale odour filled the air. Ah,
what loneliness, what an end!"</p>

<p>If I have quoted this ugly and vulgar picture
of the poet's body in the sordid room I have done
so with intention.</p>

<p>It is in the contemplation of such scenes as
this that our minds and hearts are uplifted from
the material to the supreme hope of all of us.
The man who had suffered and sinned and done
noble things in this world had gone away from
it. Doubtless, when the Frenchman with his
prying eyes and notebook was gloating over the
material sensation of the scene, the soul of the
poet was hearing harmonies too long unknown
to it, and was beginning to undergo the Purification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Oscar Wilde was always a loving student of
Dante. In that contempt for the world's opinion,
which is sometimes the strength and also the
ruin of great geniuses, Wilde bore a strong
resemblance to the great Italian who said
"Lascia dir le genti." The versatility of Oscar
Wilde was supreme, and that is in itself the real
solution of whatever is most astonishing in his
power or startling in his madness, of all that
most draws us towards him or repels us with an
equal strength. "A variety of powers almost
boundless, a pride not less vast in displaying
them&mdash;a susceptibility of new impressions and
impulses, even beyond the usual allotment of
genius ... such were the two great and leading
sources of all that varied spectacle which his life
exhibited; and that succession of victories achieved
by his genius, in almost every field of mind that
genius ever trod, and of all those sallies of character
in every shape and direction that unchecked
feeling and dominant self-will can dictate."</p>

<p>It is not for the author of this memoir, whose
attitude has been studiously impersonal throughout,
to attempt any dictation to his readers as to
the judgment they shall ultimately form upon
the character of Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>At the same time, he hopes that it may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
be forbidden him to give his own, and doubtless
very imperfect, view. He thinks that in regarding
the whole field of the poet's life, as far as it
can be known to others, one finds him to be a
sweet and noble nature with much of the serenity
of "highness" which accompanies a great genius,
yet, obscured, soiled, overlapped, and periodically
destroyed by a terrible and riotous madness, both
of talk and of thought. It is a facile and
dangerous thing to attribute all the good and
noble actions of any man to his "real self," and
to say that all the evil he wrought and did came
from madness or irresponsibility. If such a
doctrine were to be generally accepted and
believed, laws would lose their <i>raison d'être</i>,
punishment would become a mockery, and society
would inevitably end.</p>

<p>Yet, possibly it may be that some few souls
exist and have existed of whom such a statement
may be true. If such exceptions do exist and
have existed, then surely Oscar Wilde was one
of them. There seems to be no other explanation
of him but just this; and if we do not accept
it I, at anyrate, cannot see any other.</p>

<p>Let each reader of this book appropriate his
own, and I conclude the first part of it by repeating
the old, old prayer&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DRAMATIST" id="THE_DRAMATIST"></a>THE DRAMATIST</h2>


<p>When Mr George Alexander produced "Lady
Windermere's Fan" at the St James's Theatre,
in the spring of 1892, it created an unprecedented
furore among all ranks of the playgoing public,
and placed the author at once upon a pedestal in
the Valhalla of the Drama; not on account of
the plot, which was frankly somewhat <i>vieux jeu</i>,
nor yet upon any striking originality in the
types of the personages who were to unravel it,
but upon the sparkle of the dialogue, the brilliancy
of the epigrams, a condition of things to
which the English stage had hitherto been
entirely unaccustomed. The author was acclaimed
as a playwright who had at last succeeded
in clothing stagecraft with the vesture
of literature, and with happy phrase and nimble
paradox delighted the minds of his audience.
What promise of a long succession of social
comedies, illuminated by the intimate knowledge
of his subject that he so entirely possessed, was
held out to us! Here was a man who treated
society as it really exists; who was himself living
in it; portraying its folk as he knew them, with
their virtues and vices coming to them as naturally
as the facile flow of their conversation;
conversation interlarded with no stilted sentences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
no well- (or ill-) rounded periods, but such as
that which falls without conscious effort from
the lips of people who, in whatever surroundings
they may be placed, are, before all things, and at
all times, thoroughly at their ease. It may be
objected that people in real life, even in the
higher life of the Upper Ten, do not habitually
scatter sprightly pleasantries abroad as they sit
around the five-o'clock tea-table. That Oscar
Wilde made every personage he depicted talk as
he himself was wont to talk. <i>Passe encore.</i> The
real fact remains that he <i>knew</i> the social atmosphere
he represented, had breathed it, and was
familiar with all its traditions and mannerisms.
He gave us the <i>tone</i> of Society as it had never
before been given. He was at home in it. He
could exhibit a ball upon the stage where real
ladies and gentlemen assembled together, quite
distinct from the ancient "Adelphi guests" who
had hitherto done yeoman's service in every form
of entertainment imagined by the dramatist. The
company who came to his great parties were at
least <i>vraisemblables</i>, beings who conducted themselves
as if they really might have been there.
And so it was in every scene, in every situation.
His types are drawn with the pen of knowledge,
dipped in the ink of experience. That was his
secret, the keynote of his success. And with
what power he used it the world is now fully
aware. It is not too much to say that Oscar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Wilde revolutionised dramatic art. Henceforth
it began to be understood that the playwright
who would obtain the merit of a certain plausibility
must endeavour to infuse something of
the breath of life into his creations, and make
them act and talk in a manner that was at least
possible.</p>

<p>It has been a popular <i>pose</i> among certain
superior persons, equally devoid of humour
themselves as of the power of appreciating it
in others, that Oscar Wilde sacrificed dramatic
action to dialogue; that his plays were lacking
in human interest, his plots of the very poorest;
a fact that was skilfully concealed by the sallies
of smart sayings and witty repartee, which carried
the hearers away during the representation, so
that in the charm of the style they forgot the
absence of the substance. But such is by no
means the case. The author recognised, with
his fine artistic <i>flair</i>, that mere talk, however
admirable, will not carry a play to a successful
issue without a strong underlying stratum of
histrionic interest to support it. There are
situations in his comedies as powerful in their
handling as could be desired by the most devout
stickler for dramatic intention. There are scenes
in which the humorist lays aside his motley,
and becomes the moralist, unsparing in his
methods to enforce, <i>à l'outrance</i>, the significance
of his text. In each of his plays there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
moments in which the action is followed by the
spectator with absorbed attention; incidents of
emotional value treated in no half-hearted fashion.
Such are the hall mark of the true dramatist who
can touch, with the unerring instinct of the poet,
the finest feelings, the deepest sympathies of his
audience, and which place Oscar Wilde by the
side of Victorien Sardou. As has been well
written by one of our most impartial critics:
"No other among our playwrights equals this
distinguished Frenchman, either in imagination
or in poignancy of style."</p>

<p>Again, it has been contended, with a sneer, that
the turning out of witty speeches is but a trick,
easy of imitation by any theatrical scribe who
sets himself to the task. But how many of
Wilde's imitators&mdash;and there have been not a
few&mdash;have accomplished such command of
language, such literary charm, such "fineness"
of wit? Who among them all has ever managed
to hold an audience spellbound in the same way?
How many have succeeded in drawing from a
miscellaneous crowd of spectators such spontaneous
expressions of delighted approval as
"How brilliant! How true!" first muttered
by each under the breath to himself, and then
tossed loudly from one to the other in pure
enjoyment, as the solid truth, underlying the
varnish of the paradox, was borne home to them?
Surely, not one can be indicated. Nor is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
reason far to seek. For in all Oscar Wilde's
seemingly irresponsible witticisms it is not only
the device of the inverted epigram that is made
a characteristic feature of the dialogue; there is
real human nature behind the artificialities, there
is poetry beneath the prose, the grip of the
master's hand in seemingly toying with truth.
And it is the possession of these innate qualities
that differentiates the inventor from his imitators,
and leaves them hopelessly behind in the race for
dramatic distinction.</p>

<p>To invent anything is difficult, and in proportion
to its merits praiseworthy. To cavil at that
which has been devised, to point with the finger
of scorn at its imperfections, to "run it down,"
is only too easy a pastime. Oscar Wilde was
before all an inventor. Whatever he touched
he endowed with the gracious gift of style that
bore the stamp of his own individual genius.
He originated a new treatment for ancient
themes. For there is no such thing as an absolutely
new "plot." Every play that has been
written is founded on doings, dealings, incidents
that have happened over and over again. Love,
licit or illicit, the mainspring of all drama, is the
same to-day as it was yesterday, and will be for
ever and ever in this world. One man and one
woman, or one woman and two men, or again,
as a pleasant variant, two women and one man.
Such are the eternal puppets that play the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of Love upon the Stage of Life; the unconscious
victims of the sentiment which sometimes makes
for tragedy. They are always with us, placed in
the same situations, and extricating themselves
(or otherwise) in the same old way. So that
when a new playwright is condemned by the
critics as a furbisher-up of well-known <i>clichés</i> he
is hardly treated. He cannot help himself. He
must tread the familiar paths, <i>faute de mieux</i>.
And the public, with its big human heart and
unquestioning traditions, knows this, and is satisfied
therewith. Nothing really pleases people so
much as to tell them something they already
know. What an accomplished dramatist can do
is to rehabilitate his characters by the power of
his own personality, and by felicitous treatment
invest his action with fresh interest. And this
is what Oscar Wilde effected in stagecraft. He
vitalised it.</p>

<p>It is well-nigh impossible, under the existing
conditions of the theatre in England, to form
any just appreciation of the dramatist's work at
all. A novel may be read at any time, but a
play depends on the caprice of a manager to
"present" it or not, as suits his commercial convenience.
Happily for us the comedies of Oscar
Wilde are printed and published, and can be
enjoyed equally in the study as in the stalls.
We must go back to Congreve and Sheridan to
find a parallel. It is the triumph of the <i>littérateur</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
over the histrionic hack, the man whose
volumes are taken down from the shelves where
they repose, again and again, and require no
adventitious aid of scenery and costume to
enhance the pleasure they afford. Albeit that
the habit of reading plays is not particularly an
English one. The old Puritan feeling that all
things theatrical were tainted with more or less
immorality still clings to many a mind. Emotion
is yet looked upon with suspicion, and as the
theatre is the hotbed of emotion it is even now
regarded in some quarters as a dangerous, if exciting,
pleasure-ground. Sober-minded folk prefer
rather to take their doses of love tales in the
form of the novel, however inexpert, than in that
of the play, however masterly it may be. Let
an author put to the vote his appeal to his public
through their eyes or their ears, it will be found
that the eyes have it. They prefer to stop at
home and read, as they consider, seriously, than
to go abroad and listen to what they hold to be,
trivialities. Oscar Wilde has, in great measure,
been instrumental in putting these illiberal views
to flight. Men and women are now to be found
in the theatre when his pieces are represented
who not so long ago pooh-poohed the drama
from an intelligent standpoint. He has turned
attention to the fact that the dramatic method
of telling a story may be made as intellectually
interesting as in the best-written romances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the novelist. He brought to bear upon his
work a singular power of observation, a fine
imagination, a unique wit, and above all, and
beneath all, an extensive knowledge of human
life, and human character. Plays imbued with
all these qualities were bound to make their
mark. He knocked away the absurd conventions,
the stereotyped phrases of the stage as he
knew it. He placed on it living people in the
place of mechanical puppets, and by his happy
inspiration created a new order in the profession
of dramaturgy.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting subject for speculation&mdash;were
it not such a deeply sad one&mdash;how
far Oscar Wilde, had he been permitted to live,
would have gone in the new <i>voie</i> he had chosen
for the expression of his artistic perceptions.
Between "Lady Windermere's Fan" and "The
Importance Of Being Earnest," the first and last
of his comedies, there is evidence of very marked
and rapid advancement in his art. In the former
he shows us the invention of a hitherto unhandseled
form of histrionic composition&mdash;the
dialogue-drama. But he is feeling his way in
this new departure of his, diffident of its success;
while in the latter he has perfected what was
more or less crude, incomplete, found wanting,
and what was originally the natural hesitation of
the novice has developed into the assured pronouncements
of the adept. He was moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
onwards. He was making theatrical history.
He was becoming a power. And we who now
read, mark, learn, be it on the stage or in the
study, what he achieved in the production of but
four modern comedies, can only premise that
to-day he would have "arrived" at the meridian
of his art. For, not in vain, was born the
delicate wit that played around a philosophy of
life, founded upon subtle observation, and one
that has animated some of the most prominent
literary and dramatic productions of our generation.
Not in vain was struck that note of truth
and sincerity in social ethics, unheard in the <i>ad
captandum</i> strains of our professional novelists.
Underlying those "phraseological inversions," so
daintily cooed by the dove, was the wisdom of
the serpent. It is the spirit of the poet speaking
through the medium of prose. It is the utterance
of the great artist that must compel
attention even from the Philistines who sit in
the seats of the scornful.</p>

<h2><a name="LADY_WINDERMERES_FAN" id="LADY_WINDERMERES_FAN"></a>"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN"</h2>

<p>(<i>Produced by Mr George Alexander at the St James's Theatre
on 22nd February 1892</i>)</p>


<p>I Have endeavoured to indicate, I trust more or
less successfully, the manner in which an enthusiastic
public received the first of Oscar Wilde's
comedies. Let us now glance at the attitude
affected by the critics. It is not too much to
say that it was of undoubted hostility. Their
verdict was decidedly an inimical one. They
had received an unexpected shock, and were
staggering under it in an angry, helpless way.
The new dramatist was a surprise, and an unpleasing
one. He had in one evening destroyed
the comfortable conventions of the stage, hitherto
so dear to the critic's heart. He had dared
to break down the barriers of ancient prejudice,
and attempt something new, something original.
In a word, he had dared to be himself, the most
heinous offence of all! They could not entirely
ignore his undeniable talent. Public opinion
was on his side. So they dragged in side issues
to point <i>their</i> little moral, and adorn <i>their</i> little
tale. This is how Mr Clement Scott writes
after the first performance of "Lady Windermere's
Fan":</p>

<blockquote><p>"Supposing, after all, Mr Oscar Wilde is
a cynic of deeper significance than we take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
him to be. Supposing he intends to reform
and revolutionise Society at large by sublime
self-sacrifice. There are two sides to every
question, and Mr Oscar Wilde's piety in social
reform has not as yet been urged by anybody.
His attitude has been so extraordinary that I am
inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.
It is possible he may have said to himself, 'I
will show you, and prove to you, to what an
extent bad manners are not only recognised, but
endorsed in this wholly free and unrestricted
age. I will do on the stage of a public theatre
what I should not dare to do at a mass meeting
in the Park. I will uncover my head in the
presence of refined women, but I refuse to put
down my cigarette. The working man may put
out his pipe when he spouts, but my cigarette is
too 'precious' for destruction. I will show no
humility, and I will stand unrebuked. I will
take greater liberties with the public than any
author who has ever preceded me in history.
And I will retire scatheless. The society that
allows boys to puff cigarette smoke in the faces
of ladies in the theatre corridors will condone
the originality of a smoking author on the stage.'
This may be the form of Mr Oscar Wilde's curious
cynicism. He may say, 'I will test this
question of manners, and show that they are not
nowadays recognised.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>So far Mr Clement Scott, then the leader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the critic band who took his tone and cheerfully
followed where he led&mdash;the old story of "Les
brebis de Pannege." And to show how universal
was this inordinate enmity, I will quote a
paragraph from, at that time, the leading journal
of historical criticism, written on the withdrawal
of the play after a successful "run" of nine
months. After endorsing the general opinion
of the play as "A comedy of Society manners
pure and simple which may fairly claim its place
among the recognised names in that almost
extinct class of drama," the writer goes on to
say in the conclusion of his article&mdash;"Not the
least amusing reminiscence will be the ferocious
wrath which, on its first appearance, the play
provoked among the regular stage-critics, almost
to a man. Except that Mr Wilde smoked a
cigarette when called on, it is difficult to see
why&mdash;unless it was because the comedy ran off
the beaten track which is just what they are
always deprecating." In this last sentence lies
the <i>clou</i> of the whole situation. The entire
band had been clamouring for years for something
fresh, "off the beaten track," and this
is how they received it when they got it!
Verily, the ways of criticism are indeed marvellous,
and difficult of comprehension. But
the author triumphed over them all and
won his laurels despite the forces arrayed
against him. His first comedy was a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
success.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that there is nothing new
in the plot of "Lady Windermere's Fan." It is
an old tale of intrigue which has done duty on
the stage over and over again. It has inspired
many a play. But as I before observed, it is in
its treatment by the accomplished hand that the
novelty of drama lies. And here we have an
interesting example of how old lamps may be
made to look new at the touch of the magician's
wand.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Windermere have been
married for a couple of years when the action
of the play commences. It was a love-match,
and the sky of happiness has hitherto been without
a cloud. But the cloud at last appears in
the guise of a certain Mrs Erlynne, a somewhat
notorious <i>divorcée</i>, who has managed to gain
admission into Society, in a half-acknowledged
way, by means of her charms and her cash.
The cash is supplied by Lord Windermere, and
is in the nature of hush-money. For Mrs
Erlynne turns out to be no other than Lady
Windermere's mother, supposed to be long dead,
and the "cloud" might prove an uncommonly
inconvenient one if allowed suddenly to burst
upon the unsuspicious <i>ménage</i>. So she is kept
quiet by the cheques of her son-in-law. But her
friends are not backward in enlightening Lady
Windermere as to her husband's frequent visits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to Mrs Erlynne, and one of them, the Duchess
of Berwick, is more outspoken than the others,
and succeeds in persuading poor innocent-minded
Lady Windermere that the worst constructions
should be placed upon his lordship's conduct.
Mrs Erlynne has managed to induce Lord
Windermere to send her a card for his wife's
birthday ball, whereat, Lady Windermere, when
she hears of this from her husband's lips, declares
she will insult the guest openly if she arrives.
But she does arrive and she is not insulted,
although the celebrated fan is grasped ready to
strike the blow! The ball passes off quietly
enough, without any open scandal. But Lady
Windermere, surprising, as she imagines, her
husband in a compromising <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the
fascinating intruder, determines in a moment
of nervous tension to leave the house, and betake
herself to the rooms of Lord Darlington,
who earlier in the evening has offered her his
sympathy, and his heart. Before she departs,
however, she writes her husband a letter informing
him of her intentions. This letter she leaves
on a bureau where he is sure to find it. It is
not he who finds it, however, but Mrs Erlynne.
With the instinct born of a past and vast experience
she scents danger, and opens and reads
it. Then her better feelings and worse heart
are suddenly awakened, and she determines, at
all risks, to save her daughter. Whereupon she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
follows her to Lord Darlington's rooms, and,
after a long scene between the two women,
induces Lady Windermere to return to her
husband before her flight is discovered. But it
is too late. Lord Darlington, with a party of
friends including Lord Windermere, is returning.
Their voices are heard outside the door. Lady
Windermere hides behind a curtain ready to
escape on the first opportunity, while Mrs
Erlynne&mdash;when Lord Windermere's suspicions
are aroused at the sight of his wife's fan, and he
insists on searching the room&mdash;comes forth from
the place where she had concealed herself, and
boldly takes upon herself the ownership of the
fatal <i>pièce á conviction</i>. Lady Windermere is
saved, and at the end of the play is reconciled to
her husband without uncomfortable explanations,
while Mrs Erlynne marries an elderly adorer,
who is brother to the Duchess of Berwick.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is the plot of "Lady Windermere's
Fan." Every playgoer will at once recognise
its situations, and hail its intrigue as an
old and well-tried friend; the loving husband
and wife, the fascinating adventuress who comes
between them and cannot be explained; the
tempter who offers substantial consolation to
the outraged wife; the compromising fan, or
scarf, or glove (<i>selon les gôuts</i>) found by the
husband in the room of the other man; the
convenient curtain closely drawn as if to invite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
concealment; the hairbreadth escape of the wife
leaving the <i>onus</i> of the scandal to fall upon the
shoulders of some self-sacrificing friend; the
final reconciliation of husband and wife without
any infelicitous catechism; are not these things
written in the pages of all the plays that&mdash;as
George Meredith so happily puts it&mdash;"deal with
human nature in the drawing-rooms of civilised
men and women." With certain variations they
are the mainstay&mdash;the French word is <i>l'armature</i>&mdash;of
every comedy of genteel passions and misunderstandings
that ever existed. Now, how
does Oscar Wilde contrive to clothe this dramatic
skeleton with the flesh and blood of real life?
How invest the familiar figures with the plausible
presentment of new-born interest? Simply by
the wonderful power of his personality, which
dominates all he touches, and rejuvenates the
venerable bones of his <i>dramatis personæ</i>, compelling
them, after the fashion of the "Pied
Piper," to dance to any tune he chooses to call.
Or, perhaps, "sing" would be a better expression
than "dance." For it is in what they say, rather
than what they do, that our chief interest in them
lies. We do not ask: "What are they going to
do next?" That is more or less a forgone conclusion.
But what we wait for with alert attention
is what they are going to say next. And
so we come back to that brilliant dialogue which
is, as it should be, the chief feature of the play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
albeit that play is as well constructed as any
could desire, straightforward and convincing.
As a critic once wrote of it from the craftsman's
point of view: "'Lady Windermere's Fan' as a
specimen of true comedy is a head and shoulders
above any of its contemporaries. It has nothing
in common with farcical comedy, with didactic
comedy, or the 'literary' comedy of which we
have heard so much of late from disappointed
authors, whose principal claim to literature
appears to consist in being undramatic. It is
a distinguishing note of Mr Wilde that he has
condescended to learn his business, and has
written a workmanlike play as well as a good
comedy. Without that it would be worthless."
In corroboration of this statement it is only
necessary to note how skilfully, when it comes
to the necessity of dramatic action, these scenes
are handled. Take the one in the second act,
where Mrs Erlynne, more or less, forces her way
into Lady Windermere's ballroom. It is an
episode of extreme importance, and how well
led up to! Lord and Lady Windermere are on
the stage together.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lord Windermere.</i> Margaret, I <i>must</i> speak to
you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Windermere.</i> Will you hold my fan for
me, Lord Darlington? Thanks. (<i>Comes down to
him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lord Windermere.</i> (<i>Crossing to her.</i>) Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
what you said before dinner was, of course, impossible?</p>

<p><i>Lady Windermere.</i> That woman is not coming
here to-night!</p>

<p><i>Lord Windermere.</i> (<i>R.C.</i>) Mrs Erlynne is coming
here, and if you in any way annoy or wound
her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both.
Remember that! Ah, Margaret! only trust me!
A wife should trust her husband.</p>

<p><i>Lady Windermere.</i> London is full of women
who trust their husbands. One can always
recognise them. They look so thoroughly unhappy.
I am not going to be one of them.
(<i>Moves up.</i>) Lord Darlington, will you give me
back my fan, please? Thanks.... A useful
thing a fan, isn't it?... I want a friend to-night,
Lord Darlington. I didn't know I would
want one soon.</p>

<p><i>Lord Darlington.</i> Lady Windermere! I
knew the time would come some day: but why
to-night?</p>

<p><i>Lord Windermere.</i> I <i>will</i> tell her. I must.
It would be terrible if there were any scene.
Margaret....</p>

<p><i>Parker</i> (<i>announcing</i>). Mrs Erlynne.</p>

<p>(<i>Lord Windermere starts. Mrs Erlynne
enters, very beautifully dressed and very dignified.

then lets it drop on the floor. She bows coldly
to Mrs Erlynne, who bows to her sweetly in turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and sails into the room.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>If this is not effective stagecraft, I do not
know what is. And the dramatist strikes a
deeper, and more tragic, note in the scene later
on (in the same act) where Mrs Erlynne discovers
the letter of farewell that Lady Windermere
had written to her husband.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Parker enters, and crosses towards the ballroom,
R. Enter Mrs Erlynne.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs Erlynne.</i> Is Lady Windermere in the
ballroom?</p>

<p><i>Parker.</i> Her ladyship has just gone out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Erlynne.</i> Gone out? She's not on the
terrace?</p>

<p><i>Parker.</i> No, madam. Her Ladyship has just
gone out of the house.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Erlynne</i> (<i>Starts and looks at the servant
with a puzzled expression on her face</i>). Out of the
house?</p>

<p><i>Parker.</i> Yes, madam&mdash;her Ladyship told me
she had left a letter for his Lordship on the table.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Erlynne.</i> A letter for Lord Windermere?</p>

<p><i>Parker.</i> Yes, madam.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Erlynne.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit Parker. The music in the ballroom
stops.</i>)</p>

<p>Gone out of her house! A letter addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to her husband!</p>

<p>(<i>Goes over to bureau and looks at letter.
Takes it up and lays it down again with a
shudder of fear.</i>)</p>

<p>No, no! it would be impossible! Life doesn't
repeat its tragedies like that! Oh, why does
this horrible fancy come across me? Why do
I remember now the one moment of my life
I most wish to forget? Does life repeat its
tragedies?</p>

<p>(<i>Tears letter open and reads it, then sinks down
into a chair with a gesture of anguish.</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, how terrible! the same words that twenty
years ago I wrote to her father! And how
bitterly I have been punished for it! No; my
punishment, my real punishment is to-night, is
now!</p></blockquote>

<p>I have quoted these two episodes from the
second act to demonstrate how equal was the
playwright to the exigencies of his art. But it
is in the third act, laid in Lord Darlington's
rooms, that he reaches the level of high dramatic
skill. First, in the scene between the mother
and daughter, written with extraordinary power
and pathos, and later on, when each of the
women are hidden, the "man's scene" which
ranks with the famous club scene in Lord
Lytton's "Money." The <i>blasé</i> and genial tone
of these men of the world is admirably caught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Their conversation sparkles with wit and wisdom&mdash;of
the world <i>bien entendu</i>. But it is in Mrs
Erlynne's appeal to her daughter, with all its
tragic intent that the author surpasses himself.
Just read it over. It is a masterpiece of restrained
emotion.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs Erlynne.</i> (<i>Starts with a gesture of pain.
Then restrains herself, and comes over to where
Lady Windermere is sitting. As she speaks, she
stretches out her hands towards her, but does not
dare to touch her.</i>) Believe what you choose
about me. I am not without a moment's sorrow.
But don't spoil your beautiful young life on my
account. You don't know what may be in store
for you, unless you leave this house at once.
You don't know what it is to fall into the pit, to
be despised, mocked, abandoned, sneered at&mdash;to
be an outcast! to find the door shut against one,
to have to creep in by hideous byways, afraid
every moment lest the mask should be stripped
from one's face, and all the while to hear the
laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than
all the tears the world has ever shed. You don't
know what it is. One pays for one's sin, and
then one pays again, and all one's life one pays.
You must never know that. As for me, if
suffering be an expiation, then at this moment
I have expiated all my faults, whatever they have
been; for to-night you have made a heart in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
who had it not, made it and broken it. But let
that pass. I may have wrecked my own life,
but I will not let you wreck yours. You&mdash;why
you are a mere girl, you would be lost. You
haven't got the kind of brains that enables a
woman to get back. You have neither the wit
nor the courage. You couldn't stand dishonour.
No! go back, Lady Windermere, to the husband
who loves you, whom you love. You have a
child, Lady Windermere. Go back to that child
who even now, in pain or in joy, may be calling
to you. (<i>Lady Windermere rises.</i>) God gave
you that child. He will require from you that
you make his life fine, that you watch over him.
What answer will you make to God, if his life is
ruined through you? Back to your house, Lady
Windermere&mdash;your husband loves you. He
has never swerved for a moment from the love
he bears you. But even if he had a thousand loves,
you must stay with your child. If he was harsh
to you, you must stay with your child. If he ill-treated
you, you must stay with your child. If he
abandoned you your place is with your child.</p>

<p>(<i>Lady Windermere bursts into tears and
buries her face in her hands.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Rushing to her</i>). Lady Windermere!</p>

<p><i>Lady Windermere</i> (<i>holding out her hands to
her, helplessly, as a child might do</i>). Take me
home. Take me home.</p></blockquote>

<p>Few people who witnessed that situation could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
have done so without being deeply moved. It
is Oscar Wilde the poet who speaks, not to the
brain but to the heart.</p>

<p>Then turn from the shadow of that scene to
the shimmer of the one that follows immediately,
full of smartness and <i>jeu d'esprit</i>. The
sprightly and irresponsible chatter of men of the
world.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Dumby.</i> Awfully commercial, women nowadays.
Our grandmothers threw their caps over
the mill, of course, but, by Jove, their granddaughters
only throw their caps over mills that
can raise the wind for them.</p>

<p><i>Lord Augustus.</i> You want to make her out
a wicked woman. She is not!</p>

<p><i>Cecil Graham.</i> Oh! wicked women bother
one. Good women bore one. That is the only
difference between them.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Dumby.</i> In this world there are only two
tragedies. One is not getting what one wants,
and the other is getting it. The last is much
the worst, the last is a real tragedy.</p>

<p><i>Cecil Graham.</i> What is a cynic?</p>

<p><i>Lord Darlington.</i> A man who knows the
price of everything and the value of nothing.</p>

<p><i>Cecil Graham.</i> And a sentimentalist, my dear
Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
in everything, and doesn't know the market
price of any single thing.</p>

<p><i>Dumby.</i> Experience is the name everyone
gives to their mistakes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Lord Windermere.</i> What is the difference
between scandal and gossip?</p>

<p><i>Cecil Graham.</i> Oh! gossip is charming! History
is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made
tedious by morality. Now I never moralise.
A man who moralises is usually a hypocrite, and
a woman who moralises is invariably plain.
There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming
to a woman as a Nonconformist conscience.
And most women know it, I'm glad to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so we take our leave of "Lady Windermere's
Fan."</p>

<h2><a name="A_WOMAN_OF_NO_IMPORTANCE" id="A_WOMAN_OF_NO_IMPORTANCE"></a>"A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE"</h2>

<p>(<i>First produced at the Haymarket Theatre by Mr Beerbohm Tree
on 19th April 1903</i>)</p>


<p>Perhaps of all Oscar Wilde's plays "The
Woman Of No Importance" provoked the most
discussion at the time of its production. It was
his second venture in the histrionic field, and
people expected much. They felt that he should
now be finding his feet, that whatever shortcomings,
from the point of view of stagecraft,
there may have been in "Lady Windermere's
Fan," should now be made good. His first
comedy was a well-constructed play of plot and
incidents. But now, expectation rose high, and
required of the author something better, something
greater, something more considerable than
what he had achieved before. How far were
these expectations realised? How did the first-night
audience of public, and critics, receive the
new play? It must be confessed it was with a
feeling akin to disappointment. People at first
were undeniably disconcerted. They had come
prepared to witness drama, possibly of stirring
interest, and what they heard was dialogue of
brilliant quality, indeed, but which, up to a
certain point, had little to do in forwarding the
action of the piece. It was a surprise, and, to
most of them, a not altogether grateful one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
And it came in the first act. Here the author
had actually been bold enough to defy popular
traditions, and to place his characters seated in a
semicircle uttering epigram after epigram, and
paradox upon paradox, without any regard to
whatever plot there might be; for it is not until
the curtain is about to fall that we get an indication,
for the first time, that something is going
to happen in the next act. Here was an upset
indeed! A subversion of all preconceived ideas
as to how a play should begin! "Words!
words!" they muttered captiously, although the
words were as the pearls and diamonds that fell
from the mouth of the maiden in the fairy tale.
And so on, through scene after scene, until we
come to the unexpected meeting of Lord Illingworth
with the woman he had, long ago, betrayed
and abandoned. Then quickly follows the
pathetic interview between mother and son,
culminating in Mrs Arbuthnot's confession that
the man who would befriend her son is no other
than his own father, to whom he should owe
nothing, save the disgrace of his birth, leading
up to the <i>scene-à-faire</i> in the final act, where
Lord Illingworth's offer to make reparation to
the woman he has wronged is acknowledged by
a blow across the face. Here at last was drama,
treated in the right spirit, and of an emotional
value that cannot be too highly recognised.
But the shock of the earlier acts had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
severe one, and it took all the intense human
interest of the last two acts to atone for the outraged
conventions of the two first. It speaks
volumes of praise for the playwright's powers
that he was enabled to carry his work to a successful
issue, and secure for it a long run. And
not only that, but to stand the critical test of
revival. For, at the moment of writing these
words, Mr Tree has reproduced "The Woman
Of No Importance" at His Majesty's Theatre,
which is crowded, night after night, with
audiences eager to bring a posthumous tribute
to the genius of the author.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of the first act where all the <i>dramatis
personæ</i> are seated in a semicircle engaged only
in conversation, and which was likened, on the
occasion of the first production of the play, by an
eminent critic to "Christy Minstrelism Crystallised,"
it may not be uninteresting to note, <i>en
passant</i>, a similar arrangement of characters in a
play of Mr Bernard Shaw's recently performed
at the Court Theatre. This is called "Don Juan
in Hell"&mdash;the dream from "Man and Superman"&mdash;mercifully
omitted when that play was produced.
It had nothing whatever to do with the
comedy in which it was included, but is a Niagara
of ideas, clumsily put together, and is more or
less an exposition of the Shawian philosophy.</p>

<p>"Hear the result"&mdash;I quote from the critique
in one of our leading journals&mdash;"The curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
rose at half-past two on a darkened stage draped
in black. Enter, in turn, Don Juan, Dona Ana
de Ulloa, the statue of her father, and the devil.
They sat down, and for an hour and a half
delivered those opinions of Mr Shaw with which
we are all so terribly familiar. Every now and
then there was a laugh, as, for example, when
Don Juan said: 'Wherever ladies are is hell,' or,
again, when he said: 'Have you ever had servants
who were not devils?' It was all supposed to be
very funny and very naughty, of course, especially
when the statue said to Don Juan: 'If you
dwelt in heaven, as I do, you would realise your
advantages.' And so on, and so on, <i>ad nauseum</i>."</p>

<p>See now, how the parallel scene of "only
talk" as written by Oscar Wilde was noticed
upon its revival the other day. I quote from
another journal. "Let all that can be urged
against this play be granted. None the less
is it worth watching the <i>dramatis personæ</i> do
nothing, so long as the mind may be tickled
by this unscrupulous, fastidious wit. And, even
if all the characters speak in the same accents
of paradox, their moods, the essentials of them,
are differentiated with a brilliancy of expression
which condones the lack of dramatic movement.
These things, alone, evoke my gratitude to Mr
Tree for reviving so interesting and individual a
comedy.... For even those utterances which
seem to be mere phraseological inversions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
fraught with much wisdom, and the major part
of the dialogue reflects the mind of a subtle and
daring social observer." And it was this "mind,"
keen of observation, and equipped with no
ordinary wit, that dominates an audience and
compels them to sit, as it were, spellbound
before the demonstration of the power of its
unique personality. I am informed that, to-day,
in Germany, the only two modern English
dramatists who are listened to are Oscar Wilde
and Bernard Shaw&mdash;the poet and the proser.
Truly may it be remarked: "<i>Les extrêmes se
touchent</i>."</p>

<p>The story of "The Woman Of No Importance"
is quickly told.</p>

<p>Lord Illingworth, a cynical <i>roué</i>, has, in his
youth, betrayed a too trusting young lady, who,
in consequence, gave birth to a son, by her named
Gerald. When the play begins this young fellow
is nineteen years old, and has, most hopelessly
it would seem, fallen in love with an American
heiress whose name is Hester Worsley. He is
living with his mother, called Mrs Arbuthnot, at
a quiet country village, where also resides Lady
Hunstanton, who acts as hostess to all the smart
Society folk who appear upon the scene, and
among whom Lord Illingworth is the most prominent.
His lordship, ignorant of their real
relationship, has taken a fancy to Gerald, and
offers him a private secretaryship. Whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
his future prospects brighten up considerably.
But when Mrs Arbuthnot discovers that Lord
Illingworth is no other than the man who had
wronged her, she does all in her power to persuade
her (and his) son to refuse the offer, and, driven
to extremity in her distress, tells Gerald her own
history, as that of another woman. Her efforts
are futile. The boy only says that the woman
must have been as bad as the man, and that, as
far as he can see, Lord Illingworth is now a very
good fellow, and so he means to stick to him.
Consequently, when his lordship insists upon
Gerald keeping to the bargain, and reminds his
mother that the boy will be her "judge as well
as her son," should the truth of her past be
brought to light, Mrs Arbuthnot is induced to
hold it still secret. Unfortunately for this
secret, Mrs Allonby, one of Lady Hunstanton's
guests, has goaded Lord Illingworth into promising
to kiss Miss Hester Worsley. This he does,
much to the disgust of the fair Puritan, who
loudly announces that she has been insulted.
Gerald's eyes are suddenly opened to Lord
Illingworth's turpitude, and with the unbridled
passion of the headstrong lover cries out that he
will kill him! Which, apparently, he would
have done, had not Mrs Arbuthnot stepped
forward, and to everybody's surprise intervened
with the dramatic: "No&mdash;he is your father!"</p>

<p><i>Tableau.</i> In the final act Hester Worsley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
now that she knows Mrs Arbuthnot, and is determined
in spite of all to marry Gerald, solves
every difficulty by carrying off the mother and
son to her home in the New World, where we
may presume the young couple marry, and live
happily ever afterwards. Before her departure
from England, however, Mrs Arbuthnot, maddened
by the cynical offer of tardy reparation by
marriage on the part of Lord Illingworth, strikes
him across the face with a glove, and at the end
of the play alludes to him as "a man of no
importance"; which balances his earlier description
of her as "a woman of no importance."</p>

<p>As I have pointed out elsewhere, many of the
epigrams in this play were lifted bodily from
"The Picture of Dorian Gray," but after these
are eliminated there remain enough to establish
the reputation of any dramatist as a wit and epigrammatist
of the very first rank. Much would
be forgiven for one definition alone, that of the
foxhunter&mdash;"the unspeakable in pursuit of the
uneatable." And Sheridan himself might envy
the pronouncement that "the youth of America
is its oldest tradition."</p>

<p>But apart from brilliant repartee and amusing
paradox, the piece is full of passages of rare
beauty and moments of touching pathos.
Hester Worsley's speech anent Society, which
she describes as being "like a leper in purple,"
"a dead thing smeared with gold," is as finely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
written a piece of declamation as any actress
could desire, apart from its high literary qualities;
and Mrs Arbuthnot's confession to her boy and
her appeal to him for mercy are conceived in a
spirit of delicacy and reticence that only the
highest art can attain. Her pathetic peroration:
"Child of my shame, be still the child of my
shame," touches the deepest chords of human
sorrow and anguish. With a masterly knowledge
of what the theatre requires, he gives us
Hester at the beginning of the play inveighing
against any departure from the moral code and
quoting the Old Testament anent the sins of
the father being visited on the children. "It is
God's law," she ends up&mdash;"it is God's terrible
law." Later, when she begs Mrs Arbuthnot to
come away to other climes, "where there are green
valleys and fresh waters" and the poor woman for
whom the world is shrivelled to a palm's breadth
confronts her with her own pronouncement, how
beautifully introduced is her recantation: "Don't
say that, God's law is only love." It has been
objected to Hester that she is a prig, but no girl
could be a prig who could utter a sentiment like
that. She is a fine specimen of the girlhood of
the late nineteenth century, travelled, cultured,
frank, and fearless, and above all pure. In the
artificial atmosphere of Hunstanton, where the
guests are all mere worldlings, her purity and
goodness stand out in high relief. If there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
prig it is Gerald who, whether he be listening to
Lord Illingworth's worldly teaching as to "a well-tied
tie being the first serious step in life," or
hearing the story of his mother's sin, is a singularly
uninteresting and commonplace young
man. As to the other characters they are all
admirable sketches of Society folk. Lady
Caroline Pontefract tyrannising over her husband
and making that gay old gentleman put on his
goloshes and muffler is a delightful type of those
old-fashioned <i>grandes dames</i> who have the peerage
at their fingers' ends. Nothing could be
more delightfully characteristic than her opining,
when Hester tells her that some of the States of
America are as big as France and England put
together, that they must find it very draughty.
Lady Hunstanton too, who prattles away about
everybody and everything and gets mixed up in
all her statements, as for instance, when referring
to somebody as a clergyman who wanted to be a
lunatic, she is uncertain if it was not a lunatic
who wanted to be a clergyman, but who at anyrate
wore straws in his hair or something equally
odd, is drawn with a fidelity to nature that shows
what a really great student of character Oscar
Wilde was. No less admirable a portrayal is
that of the worldly archdeacon whose wife is
almost blind, quite deaf and a confirmed invalid,
yet, nevertheless, is quite happy, for though she
can no longer hear his sermons she reads them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
home. He it is whom Lord Illingworth shocks
so profoundly, first by his assertion that every
saint has a past and every sinner has a future,
and finally by the flippant remark that the secret
of life is to be always on the lookout for temptations,
which are becoming so exceedingly scarce
that he sometimes passes a whole day without
coming across one. As literature alone, the play
deserves to live, and will live, as a <i>piece de
théâtre</i>. It has met with more success than any
play of the first class within the last twenty
years. The reason for that is not far to seek&mdash;it
is essentially human, and the woman's interest&mdash;the
keynote of the story&mdash;appeals to man and
woman equally. I have seen rough Lancashire
audiences, bucolic boors in small country towns,
and dour hard-headed Scotsmen, sit spellbound
as the story of the woman's sin and her repentance
was unfolded before them. A play that
can do that is imperishable, and it is no disparagement
to the other brilliant dramatic works of
the author that, as a popular play which will ever
find favour with audiences of every class and
kind, on account of its human interest and its
pathos, "A Woman Of No Importance" is certain
of immortality.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p><h2><a name="THE_IDEAL_HUSBAND" id="THE_IDEAL_HUSBAND"></a>"THE IDEAL HUSBAND"</h2>

<p>(<i>First produced at the Haymarket Theatre, under the management of
Mr Lewis Waller and Mr H. H. Morell on 3rd January 1895</i>)</p>


<p>This, the third of Oscar Wilde's plays in their
order of production, is undoubtedly the most
dramatic. The action is rapid, the interest of
the story sustained to the very end, and the
dialogue always to the point. Each of the
principal characters concerned in the carrying
out of the plot is a distinct individualised type.
What each one says or does is entirely in keeping
with his, or her, personality. And that personality
is in each case a well-marked and skilfully
drawn one. The four <i>personæ</i> who are engaged
in conducting the intrigue of this comedy are
Sir Robert Chiltern, Lady Chiltern (his wife),
Lord Goring, and Mrs Cheveley. A charming
<i>ingénue</i> in the person of Miss Mabel Chiltern
(Sir Robert's sister) is also instrumental in bringing
the love-interest to a happy hymeneal issue.
The author of their being has handed down to
us, in his own inimitable way, his conception of
them. Here it is:</p>

<p>"<i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> A man of forty, but
looking somewhat younger. Clean-shaven, with
finely-cut features, dark-haired and dark-eyed.
A personality of mark. Not popular&mdash;few
personalities are. But intensely admired by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the few, and deeply respected of the many. The
note of his manner is that of perfect distinction,
with a slight touch of pride. One feels that he
is conscious of the success he has made in life.
A nervous temperament, with a tired look. The
firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly
with the romantic expression in the deep-set eyes.
The variance is suggestive of an almost complete
separation of passion and intellect, as though
thought and emotion were each isolated in its
own sphere through some violence of will-power.
There is no nervousness in the nostrils, and in the
pale, thin, pointed hands. It would be inaccurate
to call him picturesque. Picturesqueness cannot
survive the House of Commons. But Vandyck
would have liked to paint his head."</p>

<p>Of <i>Lady Chiltern</i> we do not get more than
that she is "a woman of grave Greek beauty
about twenty-seven years of age."</p>

<p>This is <i>Lord Goring</i>: "Thirty-four, but
always says he is younger. A well-bred expressionless
face. He is clever, but would not
like to be thought so. A flawless dandy, he
would be annoyed if he were considered
romantic. He plays with life, and is on perfectly
good terms with the world. He is fond
of being misunderstood. It gives him a post of
vantage."</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley</i>, the <i>âme damée</i> of the plot, is
thus portrayed: "Tall, and rather slight. Lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
very thin and highly coloured, a line of scarlet on
a pallid face. Venetian red hair, aquiline nose,
a long throat. Rouge accentuates the natural
paleness of her complexion. Grey-green eyes
that move restlessly. She is in heliotrope, with
diamonds. She looks rather like an orchid, and
makes great demands on one's curiosity. In all
her movements she is extremely graceful. A
work of art on the whole, but showing the
influence of too many schools."</p>

<p>In these delicious word-pictures we gain for
once an idea as to how the author considered
his characters, both physically and psychically.
It is interesting to note that of the four published
plays this is the only one in which such
intimate directions are to be found. Was the
author, for once in a way, allowing himself a
measure of poetic licence, and giving free but
eminently unpractical play to his imagination?
Who may tell? At anyrate, however high he
may have soared in his requirements of the performers,
he comes down steadily to earth in his
management of the plot, which is acted out on
these lines.</p>

<p>In the first act we find Lady Chiltern, whose
husband is Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
giving a party at her house in Grosvenor Square.
Here, among other fashionable folk who flit
across the scene, we are introduced to Lord
Goring, between whom and Mabel Chiltern there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
is evidently a more or less serious flirtation going
on, especially on the young lady's side. Shortly
after his first entrance Lord Goring "saunters
over to Mabel Chiltern."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mabel Chiltern.</i> You are very late!</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Have you missed me?</p>

<p><i>Mabel Chiltern.</i> Awfully!</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Then I am sorry I did not stay
away longer. I like being missed.</p>

<p><i>Mabel Chiltern.</i> How very selfish of you.</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> I am very selfish.</p>

<p><i>Mabel Chiltern.</i> You are always telling me of
your bad qualities, Lord Goring.</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> I have only told you half of
them as yet, Miss Mabel....</p>

<p><i>Mabel Chiltern.</i> Well, I delight in your bad
qualities. I wouldn't have you part with one of
them.</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> How very nice of you! But
then you are always nice. By the way, I want
to ask you a question, Miss Mabel. Who
brought Mrs Cheveley here? That woman in
heliotrope who has just gone out of the room
with your brother?</p>

<p><i>Mabel Chiltern.</i> Oh, I think Lady Markby
brought her. Why do you ask?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> I hadn't seen her for years, that
is all.</p></blockquote>

<p>But Lord Goring did not say, of course, all he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
knew about the brilliant Mrs Cheveley, who is
very <i>répondue</i> in the diplomatic world at Vienna,
and has, in her day, been the heroine of much
pretty gossip. The object of her present visit to
London is to obtain an introduction to Sir Robert
Chiltern, and it is when they first meet that the
dramatic interest of the story commences. The
lady, it appears, has invested largely, too largely,
in a great political and financial scheme called
the Argentine Canal Company, acting on the
advice of a certain Baron Arnheim, now dead,
who was also a friend of Sir Robert Chiltern's.
When Mrs Cheveley informs Sir Robert what
her position is, he denounces the scheme as "a
commonplace Stock Exchange swindle."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> Believe me, Mrs Cheveley,
it is a swindle.... I sent out a special commission
to inquire into the matter privately and they
report that the works are hardly begun, and as
for the money already subscribed, no one seems
to know what has become of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>A little later on he says "the success of the
Canal depends of course on the attitude of
England, and I am going to lay the report
of the Commissioners before the House of
Commons."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> That you must not do. In
your own interests, Sir Robert, to say nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
mine, you must not do that.</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> (<i>Looking at her in wonder.</i>)
In my own interests? My dear Mrs Cheveley,
what do you mean? (<i>Sits down beside her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> Sir Robert, I will be quite frank
with you. I want you to withdraw the report
that you had intended to lay before the House,
on the ground that you have reason to believe
that the Commissioners had been prejudiced or
misinformed or something.... Will you do
that for me? (<i>Naturally Sir Robert is indignant
at the proposition, and proposes to call the lady's
carriage for her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> You have lived so long
abroad, Mrs Cheveley, that you seem to be unable
to realise that you are talking to an English
gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> (<i>Detains him by touching his
arm with her fan, and keeping it there while she is
talking.</i>) I realise that I am talking to a man
who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling
to a Stock Exchange speculator a Cabinet secret.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is unfortunately only too true. For,
years ago, when secretary to Lord Radley, "a
great important minister," Sir Robert has written
to Baron Arnheim a letter telling the Baron to
buy Suez Canal shares&mdash;a letter written three
days before the Government announced its own
purchase, and which letter also is in Mrs Cheveley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
possession! Here is a fine situation with a vengeance!
By threatening to publish the scandal
and the proofs of it in some leading newspaper,
Mrs Cheveley induces the unfortunate Sir Robert
to consent to withdraw the report, and state in
the House that he believes there are possibilities
in the scheme. In return for which she will
give him back the compromising letter. So far,
so good. She has won her cause. But, true
woman as she is, she cannot conceal her triumph
from Lady Chiltern as she is leaving the party.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> Why did you wish to meet
my husband, Mrs Cheveley?</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> Oh, I will tell you. I wanted
to interest him in this Argentine Canal Scheme,
of which I daresay you have heard. And I found
him most susceptible&mdash;susceptible to reason,&mdash;I
mean. A rare thing in a man. I converted
him in ten minutes. He is going to make a
speech in the House to-morrow night, in favour
of the idea. We must go to the Ladies' Gallery
and hear him. It will be a great occasion.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so she goes gaily away, leaving her hostess
perplexed and troubled. But in weaving her
web round the hapless husband, she had not
reckoned on the influence of the wife to disentangle
it, and set the victim free. Yet, in a
finely-conceived, and equally well-written, scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
this is what actually happened. The company
have all departed and they are alone together.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> Robert, it is not true, is it?
You are not going to lend your support to this
Argentine speculation? You couldn't.</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> (<i>Starting.</i>) Who told
you I intended to do so?</p>

<p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> That woman who has just
gone out.... Robert, I know this woman.
You don't. We were at school together....
She was sent away for being a thief. Why do
you let her influence you?</p></blockquote>

<p>Then after much painful probing as to why he
has so suddenly changed his attitude towards the
scheme, she elicits the reason.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> But if I told you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> That it was necessary,
vitally necessary.</p>

<p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> It can never be necessary to
do what is not honourable.... Robert, tell me
why you are going to do this dishonourable
thing?</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> Gertrude, you have no
right to use that word. I told you it was a
question of rational compromise. It is no more
than that.</p></blockquote>

<p>But Lady Chiltern is not to be so easily put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
off as that. Her suspicions are aroused. She
says she knows that there are "men with horrible
secrets in their lives&mdash;men who had done some
shameful thing, and who, in some critical moment,
have to pay for it, by doing some other act of
shame." She asks him boldly, is he one of these?
Then, driven to bay, he tells her the one lie of
his life.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> Gertrude, there is nothing
in my past life that you might not know.</p></blockquote>

<p>She is satisfied. But he must write a letter to
Mrs Cheveley, taking back any promise he may
have given her, and that letter must be written
at once. He tries to gain time, offers to go and
see Mrs Cheveley to-morrow; it is too late to-night.
But Lady Chiltern is inexorable, and so
Sir Robert yields, and the missive is despatched
to Claridge's Hotel. Then, seized with a sudden
terror of what the consequences may be, he turns,
with nerves all a-quiver, to his wife, pleadingly&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> O, love me always,
Gertrude, love me always.</p>

<p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> I will love you always, because
you will always be worthy of love. We needs
must love the highest when we see it! (<i>Kisses
him, rises and goes out.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>And the curtain falls upon this intensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
emotional situation.</p>

<p>If I may seem to have quoted too freely from
the dialogue, it is in part to refute the charge, so
often urged by the critics, that Oscar Wilde's
"talk is often an end in itself, it has no vital
connection with the particular play of which it
forms a part, it might as well be put into the
mouth of one character as another...." Now
in the first act of "The Ideal Husband," when
the action of the piece is being carried on at
high pressure, there is not a word of the dialogue
that is not pertinent, no sentence that is not
significant. Whatever of wit the author may
have allowed himself to indulge in springs
spontaneously from the woof of the story, it is
not, as was suggested in his earlier plays, "a
mere parasitic growth attached to it," in which
this particular comedy under consideration marks
an immense advance on the methods of "The
Woman Of No Importance." Here is strenuous
drama, treated strenuously, and dealing with the
whole gamut of human emotions. The playwright,
as he progresses in his art, does not here
permit himself to endanger the interest of the
plot by any adventitious pleasantries on the part
of the characters.</p>

<p>In the second act we are again in Grosvenor
Square, this time in a morning-room, where Sir
Robert Chiltern and Lord Goring are discussing
the awkward state of affairs. To Lord Goring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the action of Sir Robert appears inexcusable.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Robert, how could you have
sold yourself for money?</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) I did not sell
myself for money. I bought success at a great
price. That is all.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was his point of view. Lord Goring's
now is that he should have told his wife. But
Sir Robert assures him that such a confession to
such a woman would mean a lifelong separation.
She must remain in ignorance. But now the
vital question is&mdash;how is he to defend himself
against Mrs Cheveley? Lord Goring answers
that he must fight her.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> But how?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> I can't tell you how at present.
I have not the smallest idea. But everyone has
some weak point. There is some flaw in each
one of us.</p></blockquote>

<p>The conversation is interrupted by the entrance
of Lady Chiltern. Sir Robert goes out
and leaves Lord Goring and his wife together.
And there follows a scene, brief, but as fine as
any in the play, in which Lord Goring endeavours
to prepare Lady Chiltern very skilfully
for the blow that may possibly fall upon her.
He deals in generalities: "I think that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
practical life there is something about success
that is a little unscrupulous, something about
ambition that is unscrupulous always." And
again: "In every nature there are elements of
weakness, or worse than weakness. Supposing,
for instance, that&mdash;that any public man, my
father or Lord Merton, or Robert, say, had, years
ago, written some foolish letter to someone...."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> What do you mean by a foolish
letter?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> A letter gravely compromising
one's position. I am only putting an imaginary
case.</p>

<p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> Robert is as incapable of doing
a foolish thing, as he is of doing a wrong thing.</p></blockquote>

<p>She is still unshaken in the belief of her
husband's rectitude. And Lord Goring departs
sorrowing, but not before he has assured her of
his friendship that would serve her in any crisis.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lord Goring.</i> ... And if you are ever in
trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and
I will help you in every way I can. If you ever
want me ... come at once to me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then on the scene arrives Mrs Cheveley,
accompanied by Lady Markby (for whose
amusing <i>bavardage</i> I wish I could find
space) evidently to revenge herself somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
for her rebuff, ostensibly to inquire after a
"diamond snake-brooch with a ruby," which she
has lost, probably at Lady Chiltern's. Now the
audience knows all about this "brooch-bracelet,"
for has not Lord Goring found it on the sofa last
night, when flirting with Mabel Chiltern, and
recognising it as an old and somewhat ominous
friend, quietly put it in his pocket, at the same
time enjoining Mabel to say nothing about the
incident. So, of course, the jewel has not been
found in Grosvenor Square. But when the two
women are left alone, Mrs Cheveley discovers
that it was Lady Chiltern who dictated Sir
Robert's letter to her. A bitter passage of arms
occurs between them, when Lady Chiltern discusses
her adversary, who boasts herself the ally
of her husband.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> How dare you class my husband
with yourself?... Leave my house. You
are unfit to enter it. (<i>Sir Robert enters from
behind. He hears his wife's last words, and sees
to whom they are addressed. He grows deadly
pale.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> Your house! A house bought
with the price of dishonour. A house everything
in which has been paid for by fraud.
(<i>Turns round and sees Sir Robert Chiltern.</i>)
Ask him what the origin of his fortune is! Get
him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Cabinet secret. Learn from him to what you
owe your position.</p>

<p><i>Lady Chiltern.</i> It is not true! Robert! It
is not true!</p></blockquote>

<p>But Sir Robert cannot deny the accusation,
and Mrs Cheveley departs, the winner of the
contest. The act concludes with a terrible
denunciation on the part of Sir Robert of his
wife, whom he blindly accuses of having wrecked
his life, by not allowing him to accept the comfortable
offer made by Mrs Cheveley of absolute
security from all future knowledge of the sin he
had committed in his youth.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> I could have killed it for
ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed its
record, burned the one witness against me. You
prevented me.... Let women make no more
ideals of men! Let them not put them on altars
and bow before them, or they may ruin other
lives as completely as you&mdash;you whom I have so
wildly loved&mdash;have ruined mine!</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is the sincere note of Tragedy! Surely,
Oscar Wilde is among the dramatists!</p>

<p>The action of the third act takes place in the
library of Lord Goring's house. It is inspired in
the very best spirit of intrigue. Lady Chiltern,
mindful of Lord Goring's friendship, has, in the
first bewilderment of her discovery, written a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
note to him,&mdash;"I want you. I trust you. I am
coming to you. Gertrude." Lord Goring is
about to make preparations to receive her, when
his father, Lord Caversham, most inconveniently
looks in to pay him a visit, the object of which is
to discuss his son's matrimonial prospects. The
visit, therefore, promises to be a lengthy one,
and Lord Goring proposes they should adjourn
to the smoking-room, advising his servant,
Phipps, at the same time that he is expecting a
lady to see him on particular business, and who
is to be shown, on her arrival, into the drawing-room.
A lady does arrive, only she is not Lady
Chiltern, but Mrs Cheveley, who has not announced
her advent in any way. Surprised to
hear that Lord Goring is expecting a lady, and
while Phipps is lighting the candles in the
drawing-room, she occupies her spare moments
in running through the letters on the writing-table,
and comes across Lady Chiltern's note.
Here, indeed, is her opportunity. She is just
about to purloin it, when Phipps returns, and
she slips it under a silver-cased blotting-book
that is lying on the table. She is, perforce,
obliged to go into the drawing-room, from which
presently she emerges, and creeps stealthily
towards the writing-table. But suddenly voices
are heard from the smoking-room, and she is
constrained to return to her hiding-place. Lord
Caversham and his son re-enter and Lord Goring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
puts his father's cloak on for him, and with much
relief sees him depart. But a shock is in store
for him, for no sooner has Lord Caversham
vanished, than no less a personage than Sir
Robert Chiltern appears. In vain does Lord
Goring try to get rid of his most unwelcome
visitor. Sir Robert has come to talk over his
trouble, and means to stay. Lady Chiltern must
on no account be admitted. So he says to
Phipps:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lord Goring.</i> When that lady calls, tell her
that I am not expected home this evening.
Tell her that I have been suddenly called out
of town. You understand?</p>

<p><i>Phipps.</i> The lady is in that room, my lord.
You told me to show her into that room, my lord.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Goring realises that things are getting a
little uncomfortable, and again tries to send Sir
Robert away. But Sir Robert pleads for five
minutes more. He is on his way to the House
of Commons. "The debate on the Argentine
Canal is to begin at eleven." As he makes this
announcement a chair is heard to fall in the
drawing-room. He suspects a listener, and,
despite Lord Goring's word of honour to the
contrary, determines to see for himself, and goes
into the room, leaving Lord Goring in a fearful

state of mind. He soon returns, however, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
a look of scorn on his face."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> What explanation have
you to give me for the presence of that woman
here?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Robert, I swear to you on my
honour that that lady is stainless and guiltless of
all offence towards you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Chiltern.</i> She is a vile, an infamous
thing!</p></blockquote>

<p>After a few more speeches, in which the
<i>malentendu</i> is well kept up, Sir Robert goes out,
and Lord Goring rushes to the drawing-room to
meet&mdash;Mrs Cheveley.</p>

<p>And now this woman is going to have another
duel, but this time with an enemy who is proof
against her attacks. The whole of this scene is
imagined and written in a masterly manner.
After a little airy sparring, Lord Goring opens
the match.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lord Goring.</i> You have come here to sell me
Robert Chiltern's letter, haven't you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> To offer it you on conditions.
How did you guess that?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Because you haven't mentioned
the subject. Have you got it with you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> (<i>Sitting down.</i>) Oh, no! A
well-made dress has no pockets.</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> What is your price for it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Then, Mrs Cheveley tells him that the price
is&mdash;herself. She is tired of living abroad, and
wants to come to London and have a salon.
She vows to him that he is the only person she
has ever cared for, and that on the morning of
the day he marries her she will give him Sir
Robert's letter. Naturally he refuses her offer.
Naturally she is furious. But she still possesses
the incriminating document and hurls her
venomous words at his head.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs Chiltern.</i> For the privilege of being your
wife I was ready to surrender a great prize, the
climax of my diplomatic career. You decline.
Very well. If Sir Robert doesn't uphold my
Argentine Scheme, I expose him. <i>Voilà tout!</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But he cares not for her threats. He hasn't
done with her yet, for he has got in his possession
the diamond snake-brooch with a ruby!
This scene is most skilfully managed. Quite
innocently he offers to return it to her&mdash;he had
found it accidentally last night. And then in a
moment he clasps it on her arm.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> I never knew it could be worn
as a bracelet ... it looks very well on me as a
bracelet, doesn't it?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Yes, much better than when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
saw it last.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> When did you see it last?</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> (<i>Calmly.</i>) Oh! ten years ago,
on Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, he has her in his power. The bracelet
cannot be unclasped unless she knows the secret
of the spring, and she is at his mercy, a convicted
thief. He moves towards the bell to summon
his servant to fetch the police. "To-morrow the
Berkshires will prosecute you." What is she to
do? She will do anything in the world he wants.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Lord Goring.</i> Give me Robert Chiltern's
letter.</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> I have not got it with me. I
will give it you to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Lord Goring.</i> You know you are lying. Give
it me at once. (<i>Mrs Cheveley pulls the letter out
and hands it to him. She is horribly pale.</i>) This
is it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> (<i>In a hoarse voice.</i>) Yes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whereupon he burns it over the lamp. So
letter number one is got out of the way. But
there is letter number two: Lady Chiltern's to
Lord Goring. The accomplished thief sees it
just showing from under the blotting-book; asks
Lord Goring for a glass of water, and while his
back is turned steals it. So, though she has
lost the day on one count she has gained it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
another. With a bitter note of triumph in
her voice she tells Lord Goring that she is
going to send Lady Chiltern's "love-letter" to
him to Sir Robert. He tries to wrest it from
her, but she is too quick for him, and rings the
electric bell. Phipps appears, and she is safe.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs Cheveley.</i> (<i>After a pause.</i>) Lord Goring
merely rang that you should show me out.
Good-night, Lord Goring.</p></blockquote>

<p>And on this fine situation the curtain falls.</p>

<p>Space does not permit me more than to indicate
how, in the fourth and last act, Sir Robert
Chiltern has roundly denounced the Argentine
Canal Scheme in the House of Commons, and
with it the whole system of modern political
finance. How Lady Chiltern's letter to Lord
Goring does reach her husband, and is by him
supposed to be addressed to him. How Lady
Chiltern undeceives him, and confesses the truth.
How Lord Goring becomes engaged to Mabel,
and Sir Robert Chiltern accepts, after some
hesitation, a vacant seat in the Cabinet, and
peace is restored all round. These episodes,
cleverly and naturally handled, bring "The
Ideal Husband" to a satisfactory conclusion.
It is certainly the most dramatic of all Oscar
Wilde's comedies, and could well bear revival.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_IMPORTANCE_OF_BEING" id="THE_IMPORTANCE_OF_BEING"></a>"THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING
EARNEST"</h2>


<p>A deliciously airily irresponsible comedy.
Such is the "The Importance Of Being Earnest,"
the most personally characteristic expression of
Wilde's art, and the last of the dramatic productions
written under his own name. The
play bubbles over with mirth and fun. It is
one unbroken series of laughable situations and
amusing surprises. The dialogue has all the
sparkle of bubbles from a gushing spring, and
is brimful of quaint conceits and diverting paradoxes.
Even the genius of W. S. Gilbert in the
fantastic line pales before the irresponsible frolicsomeness
of the Irishman's wit. His fancy disports
itself in an atmosphere of epigrams like
a young colt in a meadow. Never since the
days of Sheridan has anything been written
to equal the brilliancy of this trifle for serious
people. No one could fail to be amused by its
delicate persiflage, its youthfulness and its utter
irresponsibility.</p>

<p>Were one to take the works of Gyp, Gilbert,
Henri Lavedan and Sheridan and roll them into
one, one would not even then obtain the essence
of sparkling comedy that animates the play. It
is a trifle, but how clever, how artistically perfect
a trifle. When it was produced at the St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
James's, in February 1895, one continuous ripple
of laughter shook the audience, even as a field
of standing corn is swayed by a passing breeze.
The reading of the play alone makes one feel
frivolous, and when the characters stood before
one, suiting the action to the word and the word
to the action, the effect was absolutely irresistible
and even the gravest and most slow-witted were
moved to rollicking hilarity. One critic summed
it up by saying that "its title was a pun, its story
a conundrum, its characters lunatics, its dialogue
a 'galimatias,' and its termination a 'sell.'
Questioned as to its merits, Wilde was credited
with saying that "The first act was ingenious,
the second beautiful, the third abominably
clever." It was most beautifully staged by Mr
George Alexander, and I can see still the charming
picture presented by Miss Millard in the
delightful garden scene as she watered her rose
bushes with a water-can filled with silver sand.
The acting, too, left nothing to be desired and
altogether it was a performance to linger in one's
memory in the years to come.</p>

<p>The Ernest of the punning title is an imaginary
brother, very wicked and gay, invented by John
Worthing, J.P., to account to his ward (Cecily
Cardew) for his frequent visits to London. John
Worthing, it may be mentioned, is a foundling
who was discovered when a baby in the cloak-room
at a railway station inside a black bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
stamped with the initials of the absent-minded
governess who had inadvertently placed him in
it instead of the manuscript of a three-volume
novel. Now, Worthing has a friend, a gay
young dog, named Alexander Moncrieffe who
likewise has invented a fictitious personage, a
sick friend, visits to whom he makes serve as
the reason of his absences from home. He has
given this imaginary friend the name of Bunbury,
and designates his little expeditions as
"Bunburying." Moncrieffe lives in town, and
is more or less the model Worthing has chosen
when describing his imaginary brother. Worthing's
ward is a romantic girl who has fallen in
love with her guardian's brother from his descriptions
of him. She is especially enamoured
of his name, Ernest, for like old Mr Shandy she
has quite pronounced views and opinions about
names. Now, the reason of Worthing's constant
visits to town is to see a young lady yclept
Gwendolen Fairfax, a cousin of Moncrieffe's, to
whom he proposes and is accepted, but, for some
unexplained reason, for his periodical visits to
town he adopts the name of Ernest, so that
Gwendolen, who, like Cecily, has distinctive
ideas about names, only knows him by that
name. So it will be seen that we have already
two Ernests in the field&mdash;the imaginary brother
whose moral delinquencies are such a cause of
worry to Cecily's guardian, and the guardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
himself masquerading as Ernest Worthing. A
pretty combination for complications to start
with, but the author strews Ernest about with
a prodigality that excites our admiration, and he
gives us a third Ernest in the person of Alexander
Moncrieffe, who, learning that his friend is left
alone at home, and that she is extremely beautiful,
determines to go down and make love to her.
In order to gain admittance to the house, he
passes himself off as Ernest Worthing, the
imaginary naughty brother, and is warmly
welcomed by Cecily. In ten minutes he has
wooed and won her, and the happy pair disappear
into the house just before John Worthing
arrives on the scene. Now that he has
proposed and been accepted there is no longer
any necessity for inventing an excuse for his
absences from home, and in order to be rid of
what might prove to be an embarrassing,
although a purely fictitious, person, he has
invented a story of his putative brother's death
in Paris. He enters dressed in complete black,
black frock-coat, black tie, black hatband, and
black-bordered handkerchief. There follows a
delightful comedy scene between him and
Algernon, whose imposture he cannot expose
without betraying himself. Meanwhile, Gwendolen
has followed her sweetheart to make the
acquaintance of Cecily, and now arrives <i>en
scene</i>. The two girls become bosom friends at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
once, and all goes happily until the name of
Ernest Worthing is mentioned, and although no
such person exists yet each of them imagines
herself to be engaged to him. The situation is,
to use a theatrical slang term, "worked up," and
the young ladies pass from terms of endearment
to mutual recriminations. A pitched battle is
on the tapis, but with the appearance of their
lovers, and their enforced explanation, peace is
restored between the two, and they join forces in
annihilating with scathing word and withering
look the wretches who have so basely deceived
them. Never, never could either of them love
a man whose name was not Ernest. Each of
them was engaged to Ernest Worthing, but,
in the words of the immortal Betsy Prig when
referring to Mrs 'Arris, "There ain't no sich
person."</p>

<p>The situation is embarrassing and complicated.
The two delinquents offer to have themselves
rechristened, but the suggestion is received with
withering scorn; the situation cannot be saved
by any such ridiculous subterfuge; the disconsolate
wretches seek consolation in an orgy
of crumpets and tea cakes. Another difficulty
there is also, Lady Bracknell&mdash;Gwendolen's
mother&mdash;refuses to accept as her son-in-law a
nameless foundling found in a railway station.
However, the production of the bag leads to the
discovery of his parentage, and it turns out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
his father was the husband of Lady Bracknell's
sister. The question of his father's Christian
name is raised, as it is thought probable that
he was christened after him, and although Lady
Bracknell cannot remember the name of the
brother-in-law a reference to the Army List
results in the discovery that it was Ernest, so
that both the difficulties of birth and nomenclature
are now overcome. As to Algernon, he
is forgiven because he explains that his imposture
was undertaken solely to see Cecily, and so
the comedy ends happily as all good comedies
should.</p>

<p>The piece is one mass of smart sayings,
brilliant epigrams, and mirth-provoking lines,
as when Miss Prism, Cecily's governess, tells
her pupil to study political economy for an hour,
but to omit, as too exciting, the depreciation of
the rupee. Some of the most delightful sayings
are put into the mouth of Lady Bracknell, the
aristocratic dowager who is responsible for the
dictum that what the age suffers from is want of
principle and want of profile. Miss Prism too
enunciates the aphorism that "Memory is the
diary we all carry about with us," and Cecily
naïvely informs us that "I keep a diary to enter
the wonderful secrets of my life. If I didn't
write them down I would probably forget all
about them." There is also a delicious touching
of feminine amenities when, during the quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
scene, Gwendolen says to Cecily, "I speak quite
candidly&mdash;I wish that you were thirty-five and
more than usually plain for your age." No
woman could have written better. Even the
love passages are replete with humorous lines.
Cecily passing her hand through Moncrieffe's
hair remarks, "I hope your hair curls naturally,"
and with amusing candour comes his reply, "Yes,
darling, with a little help from others." The
servants themselves are infected with the prevailing
atmosphere of frivolity. Moncrieffe
apostrophising his valet exclaims, "Lane, you're
a perfect pessimist," and that imperturbable individual
replies, "I do my best to give satisfaction."
Again, when he remarks on the fact that
though he had only two friends to dinner on the
previous day and yet eight bottles of champagne
appear to have been drunk, the impeccable
servant corrects him with, "Eight and a pint,
sir," and in reply to his question, how is it that
servants drink more in bachelors' chambers than
in private houses, the discreet valet explains that
it is because the wines are better, adding that
you do get some very poor wine nowadays in
private houses.</p>

<p>"What is the use of the lower classes unless
they set us a good example?" "Divorces are
made in heaven," "To have lost one parent is a
misfortune, to have lost both looks like carelessness,"
and "I am only serious about my amusements,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
are samples taken haphazard of the good
things in the play.</p>

<p>It has been objected that the piece is improbable,
but it was described by the author
merely as "a trivial comedy for serious people."
As a contributor to <i>The Sketch</i> so aptly put it at
the time, "Why carp at improbability in what
is confessedly the merest bubble of fancy? Why
not acknowledge honestly a debt of gratitude to
one who adds so unmistakably to the gaiety of
the nation?"</p>

<p>The press were almost unanimous in their
appreciation of the comedy. <i>The Athenæum's</i>
critic wrote, "The mantle of Mr Gilbert has
fallen on the shoulders of Mr Oscar Wilde, who
wears it in jauntiest fashion." And <i>The Times</i>
is responsible for the statement that "almost
every sentence of the dialogue bristles with
epigram of the now accepted pattern, the manufacture
of this being apparently conducted by
its patentee with the same facility as 'the butter-woman's
rank to market.'" But more flattering
still was the appreciation of the <i>Truth</i> critic
whose previous attitude to Wilde's work had
been a hostile one.</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest intention of seriously
criticising Mr O. Wilde's piece at the St James's,"
he writes, under the heading of "The Importance
Of Being Oscar," "as well might one sit down
after dinner and attempt gravely to discuss the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
true inwardness of a <i>soufflé</i>. Nor, unfortunately,
is it necessary to enter into details as to its wildly
farcical plot. As well might one, after a successful
display of fireworks in the back garden, set to
work laboriously to analyse the composition of a
Catherine Wheel. At the same time I wish to
admit, fairly and frankly, that 'The Importance
Of Being Earnest' amused me very much."</p>

<p>It is, however, since the author's death that
the great body of critics have emitted the opinion
that the play is really an extremely clever piece
of work and a valuable contribution to the
English drama. So many pieces are apt to get
<i>démodés</i> in a few years, but now, twelve years
after its production, "The Importance Of Being
Earnest" is as fresh as ever, and does not date,
as ladies say of their headgear. To compare the
blatant nonsense that Mr Bernard Shaw foists on
a credulous public as wit with the coruscating
<i>bon mots</i> of his dead compatriot, as seems to
be the fashion nowadays, is to show a pitiful lack
of intelligence and discernment; as well compare
gooseberry wine to champagne, the fountains in
Trafalgar Square to Niagara.</p>

<h2><a name="SALOME" id="SALOME"></a>"SALOMÉ"</h2>


<p>Of all Wilde's plays the one that has provoked
the greatest discussion and most excited the
curiosity of the public is undoubtedly "Salomé,"
which, written originally in French and then
translated into English, has finally been performed
in two Continents.</p>

<p>Never perhaps has a play, at its inception, had
less of a chance than this Biblical tragedy written
for a French Jewess (Madame Sarah Bernhardt)
banned by the English Censor and only produced
after the disgrace and consequent downfall of its
author. From Salomé's first speech to the end
of the play we realise how the little part was absolutely
identified in the author's mind with
the actress he had written it for. To anyone
who has studied, however superficially, Madame
Bernhardt's peculiar methods of diction and acting,
the words in the first speech&mdash;"I will not
stay, I cannot stay. Why does the Tetrarch
look at me all the while with his mole's eyes
under his shaking eyelids?" convey at once a
picture of the actress in the part. If there is
a fault to be found with the character it is that
Bernhardt not Salomé is depicted, and yet who
shall say that there is much difference between
the temperaments or the physique of the two
women. It is true that, in a letter to <i>The Times</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the author strenuously denied that he had written
the play for Sarah, but one is inclined to take
the denial with a very big grain of salt. That
while in detention Wilde made most strenuous
efforts to get her to produce it is a well-known
fact.</p>

<p>The play, as even Macaulay's schoolboy
knows, is based on the story of Herodias'
daughter dancing before Herod for the head of
John the Baptist.</p>

<p>An account of the episode is to be found in
the 6th chapter of the Gospel of St Mark, and it
is interesting to contrast the strong and simple
Scriptural description with the highly decorative
and glowing language of the play.</p>

<p>Here is St Mark's account of the incident:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang2">v. 21. And when a convenient day was come, that Herod
on his birthday made a supper to his lords,
high captains and chief <i>estates</i> of Galilee;</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 22. And when the daughter of the said Herodias
came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and
them that sat with him, the king said unto
the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt,
and I will give <i>it</i> thee.</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 23. And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt
ask of me, I will give <i>it</i> thee, unto the half of
my kingdom.</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 24. And she went forth, and said unto her mother,
What shall I ask? And she said, The head of
John the Baptist.</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 25. And she came in straightway with haste unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou
give me by and by in a charger the head of
John the Baptist.</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 26. And the king was exceeding sorry; <i>yet</i> for his
oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with
him, he would not reject her.</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 27. And immediately the king sent an executioner,
and commanded his head to be brought: and
he went and beheaded him in the prison,</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 28. And brought his head in a charger, and gave it
to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her
mother.</p>

<p class="hang2">v. 29. And when his disciples heard <i>of it</i>, they came
and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p></blockquote>

<p>The account given by St Matthew (xiv. 6) is
equally terse, but the fuller description of the
scene as reconstructed by Dean Farrar in his
"Life of Christ" is worth quoting.</p>

<blockquote><p>"But Herodias had craftily provided the king
with an unexpected and exciting pleasure, the
spectacle of which would be sure to enrapture
such guests as his. Dancers and dancing-women
were at that time in great request. The passion
for witnessing these too often degrading representations
had naturally made its way into the
Sadducean and semi-pagan court of these usurping
Edomites, and Herod the Great had built in
his palace, a theatre for the Thymelici. A
luxurious feast of the period was not regarded as
complete unless it closed with some gross pantomimic
representation; and doubtless Herod had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
adopted the evil fashion of his day. But he had
not anticipated for his guests the rare luxury of
seeing a princess&mdash;his own great-niece, a granddaughter
of Herod the Great and of Mariamne,
a descendant, therefore, of Simon the High Priest
and the line of Maccabæan princes&mdash;a princess
who afterwards became the wife of a tetrarch
and the mother of a king&mdash;honouring them by
degrading herself into a scenic dancer. Yet
when the banquet was over, when the guests
were full of meat and flushed with wine, Salomé
herself, the daughter of Herodias, then in the
prime of her young and lustrous beauty, executed,
as it would now be expressed, a <i>pas seul</i>
'in the midst of' those dissolute and half-intoxicated
revellers. 'She came in and danced, and
pleased Herod, and them that sat at meat with
him.' And he, like another Xerxes, in the
delirium of his drunken approval, swore to this
degraded girl, in the presence of his guests, that
he would give her anything for which she asked,
even to the half of his kingdom.</p>

<p>"The girl flew to her mother, and said, 'What
shall I ask?' It was exactly what Herodias
expected, and she might have asked for robes,
or jewels, or palaces, or whatever such a woman
loves. But to a mind like hers revenge was
sweeter than wealth or pride. We may imagine
with what fierce malice she hissed out the answer,
'The head of John the Baptiser.' And coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in before the king <i>immediately with haste</i>&mdash;(what
a touch is that! and how apt a pupil did the
wicked mother find in her wicked daughter!)&mdash;Salomé
exclaimed, 'My wish is that you give
<i>me here, immediately</i>, on a dish, the head of John
the Baptist.' Her indecent haste, her hideous
petition, show that she shared the furies of her
race. Did she think that in that infamous period,
and among those infamous guests, her petition
would be received with a burst of laughter?
Did she hope to kindle their merriment to a still
higher pitch by the sense of the delightful wickedness
involved in a young and beautiful girl
asking&mdash;nay, imperiously demanding&mdash;that then
and there, on one of the golden dishes which
graced the board, should be given into her own
hands the gory head of the Prophet whose words
had made a thousand bold hearts quail?</p>

<p>"If so, she was disappointed. The tetrarch,
at anyrate, was plunged into grief by her request;
it more than did away with the pleasure of her
disgraceful dance; it was a bitter termination of
his birthday feast. Fear, policy, remorse, superstition,
even whatever poor spark of better feeling
remained unquenched under the white ashes
of a heart consumed by evil passions, made him
shrink in disgust from this sudden execution.
He must have felt that he had been duped out
of his own will by the cunning stratagem of his
unrelenting paramour. If a single touch of manliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
had been left in him he would have repudiated
the request as one which did not fall either under
the letter or the spirit of his oaths, since the life
of one cannot be made the gift to another; or
he would have boldly declared that if such was
her choice, his oath was more honoured by being
kept. But a despicable pride and fear of man
prevailed over his better impulses. More afraid
of the criticisms of his guests than of the future
torment of such conscience as was left him, he
sent an executioner to the prison, which in all
probability was not far from the banqueting
hall&mdash;and so, at the bidding of a dissolute coward
and to please the loathly fancies of a shameless
girl, the axe fell, and the head of the noblest of
the prophets was shorn away. In darkness and
in secrecy the scene was enacted, and if any saw
it their lips were sealed; but the executioner
emerged into the light carrying by the hair that
noble head, and then and there, in all the pallor
of the recent death, it was placed upon a dish
from the royal table. The girl received it, and,
now frightful as a Megæra, carried the hideous
burden to her mother. Let us hope that those
grim features haunted the souls of both thenceforth
till death.</p>

<p>"What became of that ghastly relic we do not
know. Tradition tells us that Herodias ordered
the headless trunk to be flung out over the battlements
for dogs and vultures to devour. On her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
at anyrate, swift vengeance fell."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a footnote the Dean mentions that Salomé
subsequently married her uncle Philip, Tetrarch
of Ituræa, and then her cousin Aristobulus, King
of Chalcis, by whom she became the mother of
three sons. The traditional death of the "dancing
daughter of Herodias" is thus given by
Nicephorus. "Passing over a frozen lake, the ice
broke and she fell up to the neck in water, and
her head was parted from her body by the violence
of the fragments shaken by the water and her
own fall, and so she perished."</p>

<p>Thus the historical accounts, now for the play
itself. To begin with, let us note the stage
directions. "A great terrace in the palace of
Herod set above the banqueting hall. To the
right there is a gigantic staircase, to the left, at
the back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of
green bronze. Moonlight."</p>

<p>These directions for the setting of the stage
are for all practical purposes useless&mdash;they would
drive the most experienced stage-manager crazy,
but then Wilde, more particularly in the romantic
dramas, was sublimely indifferent to the mere
mechanical side of stagecraft. He issued his
commands and it was for the <i>gens du métier</i>
to give practical effect to them. He had the
picture in his mind; what matter if there were
practical difficulties in the way of producing it!
That was no fault of his. It is curious to contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
his stage directions with those of a practical
playwright like Shakespeare. Shakespeare, for
instance, would have simply written "soldiers
leaning over a balcony." There is a whole
chapter of difference in the introduction of the
word "some."</p>

<p>The time is night, that wonderful Judæan
night, when the air is charged with electricity
and the mysterious heart of the East throbs with
the varied emotions of the centuries. "Moonlight,"
says the directions, and here we recall the
author's almost passionate worship of moonlight.
Over and over again in play, prose, essay, and
verse, he writes about the moon. She possessed
an almost uncanny attraction for him, and one
almost wonders whether the superstition connecting
certain phases of the planet with the madness
of human beings may not account for a good deal
that remains unexplained in the erratic career of
this unfortunate genius!</p>

<p>A young Syrian, the "Captain of the Guard,"
is talking with the page of Herodias. From a
subsequent description we learn that he was
handsome with the dark languorous eyes of his
nation, and that his voice was soft and musical.
He is in love with the Princess Salomé, the
daughter of Herodias, wife of the Tetrarch of
Judæa, Herod Antipas, and his talk is all of her
and her beauty. The page, who seems to stand
in great fear of his mistress and to be likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
oppressed with a foreboding of coming evil, tries
to divert his attention to the moon, but in the
moon the enamoured Syrian sees only an image
of his beloved. Then the page strikes the first
deep note of tragedy. To him she is like a dead
woman. A noise is heard, and the soldiers comment
on it and its cause&mdash;namely, the religious
dissensions of the Jews. At this the young
Syrian, heedless of all else, breaks in once more
like a Greek chorus in praise of the Princess's
beauty. (One can almost hear an imaginary
Polonius exclaiming: "Still harping on my
daughter.") Again the page utters a warning
against the Captain's infatuation. He is certain
that something terrible may happen.</p>

<p>As if to confirm his fears the two soldiers
begin discussing the Tetrarch's sombre looks.
Plain, uncultured fellows these Roman soldiers,
and yet, like most of the legionaries, they have
travelled far afield as may be gathered from their
talk of Herod's various wives. A Cappadocian
joins in their conversation. He is completely
<i>terre à terre</i> and cannot understand anything
but the obvious. The talk drifts on to religion,
and then suddenly the voice of John the Baptist
(the Jokanaan of the play) is heard from the
cistern in which he is confined. There is a
certain <i>naïveté</i> in the introduction of this
cistern which may well provoke a smile, especially
when later we meet with the stage direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
"He goes down into the cistern." Historically
its introduction may be correct, but one wishes
that the author had chosen any other place of
confinement for the prophet, at anyrate called it
by any other name. In the utilitarian days of
water companies and water rates the image that
the word cistern evokes is painfully reminiscent
of a metal tank in the lumber-room of a
suburban residence. Even Longfellow, in one
of his most beautiful poems, failed to rob the
word of its associations.</p>

<p>The voice strikes a perfectly new note in the
play, and announces in Scriptural language the
advent of the Messiah. Then the soldiers,
taking the place of the <i>raissonneur</i> in French
plays, proceed to discuss and describe the
prophet. From them we learn that he is gentle
and holy, grateful for the smallest attentions of
his guards, that when he came from the desert
he was clothed in camel's hair. We incidentally
learn that he is constantly uttering warnings and
prophecies, and that by the Tetrarch's orders no
one is allowed to see him, much less communicate
with him. Then the Cappadocian comments
on the strange nature of the prison, and
is informed that Herodias' first husband, the
brother of Herod, was imprisoned in it for
twelve years, and was finally strangled. The
question by whom, so naturally put, introduces,
with a master's certainty of touch, another grim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
note, as Naaman, the executioner, a gigantic
negro, is pointed out as the perpetrator of the
deed. Mention is also made of the mandate
he received to carry it out in the shape of the
Tetrarch's death ring.</p>

<p>Thus the soldiers gossip among themselves
and Salomé's entrance, which takes place almost
immediately, is in stage parlance "worked up"
by the rapturous description of her movements
and her person, delivered by the Syrian, and the
awestruck pleading of the page that he should
not look at her.</p>

<p>The Princess is trembling with emotion, and
in her first speech gives us the keynote to the
action of the play by referring to the glances
of desire that Herod casts on her. To a timid
question of the Syrian's she vouchsafes no
answer, but proceeds to comment on the sweetness
of the night air and the heterogenous collection
of guests whom Herod is entertaining. The
proffer of a seat by the lovesick captain remains
likewise unnoticed, and like a chorus the
page beseeches him once more not to look at
her, and presages coming evil. And again, the
moon is invoked as this daughter of kings
soliloquises on the coldness and chastity of the
orb of heaven.</p>

<p>Her meditations are interrupted by the prophet's
voice ringing out mysteriously on the
night air, and then a long dialogue in short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
pregnant sentences takes place between Salomé
and two soldiers as to the hidden speaker. We
learn that Herod is afraid of him and that the
man of God is constantly inveighing against
Herodias.</p>

<p>From time to time the Princess is interrupted
by a messenger from the Tetrarch requesting her
to return, but she has no thought for anyone but
the prisoner in the cistern. She wishes to see
him, but is informed that this is against the
Tetrarch's orders. Then she deliberately sets
herself to make the Syrian captain disobey his
orders. She pleads with him, she plays on his
manhood by taunting him with being afraid of
his charge, she promises him a flower, "a little
green flower." He remains unmoved. The
Princess uses all her blandishments to obtain
her end; and we can realise what a clever
actress would make of the scene as she
murmurs, "I will look at you through the
muslin veils, I will look at you, Narraboth, it
may be I will smile at you. Look at me, Narraboth,
look at me." And with more honeyed
words and sentences, left unfinished, she induces
the young officer to break his trust. The speech
consists only of a few lines, and yet gives opportunity
for as fine a piece of acting as any player
could desire. The soldier yields, and the page
suddenly draws attention to the moon, in which
he discovers the hand of a dead woman drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
a shroud over herself, though the Syrian can
only discover in her a likeness to the object of
his infatuation. Jokanaan is brought forth, and
inquires for Herod, for whom he prophesies an
early death, and then for Herodias, the list of
whose iniquities he enumerates.</p>

<p>His fierce denunciations terrify Salomé, and in
a wonderful piece of word-painting she describes
the cavernous depths of his eyes and the terrors
lying behind them. The Syrian begs her not to
stay, but she is fascinated by the ivory whiteness
of the prophet's body and desire enters her soul.
Her fiery glances trouble the prophet, he inquires
who she is. He refuses to be gazed at by her
"golden eyes under her gilded eyelids." She
reveals herself, and he bids her begone, referring
to her mother's iniquities. His voice moves her
and she begs him to speak again. The young
Syrian's piteous remonstrance, "Princess!
Princess!" is unheeded, and she addresses the
prophet once more. Here follows one of the
finest and most dangerous scenes of the play,
and yet one which, properly treated, is neither
irreverent nor, as has been stupidly asserted,
immoral.</p>

<p>Maddened by desire, this high-born Princess
makes violent love in language of supreme
beauty to the ascetic dweller in the desert. His
body, his hair, his mouth, are in turn the object
of her praise only to be vilified one by one as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
drives her back with scathing words. She insists
that she shall kiss his mouth, and the jealous
Syrian begs her who is like "a garden of myrrh"
not to "speak these things." She insists, she
will kiss his mouth. The Syrian kills himself,
falling on his own sword. This tragic event, to
which a horror-struck soldier draws her attention,
does not for one second divert her attention from
the pursuit of her passion. Again and again, in
spite of Jokanaan's warnings and exhortations
(for even in this supreme hour of horror and
temptation he preaches the Gospel of his Master),
she pleads for a kiss of his mouth. This reiteration
of the request, even after the Saint has
returned to his prison, is a triumph of dramatic
craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The page laments over his dead friend to whom
he had given "a little bag full of perfumes and a
ring of agate that he wore always on his hand."
The soldiers debate about hiding the body and
then, contrary to his custom, Herod appears on
the terrace accompanied by Herodias and all the
Court. His first inquiry is for Salomé, and
Herodias, whose suspicions are evidently aroused,
tells him in identically the same words used by
the page to the dead Syrian that he "must not
look at her," that he is "always looking at her."</p>

<p>Again the regnant moon becomes a menace
and a symbol. This time it is Herod who finds
a strange look in her, and whose morbid wine-heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
imagination compares her to a naked
woman looking for lovers and reeling like one
drunk. He determines to stay on the terrace,
and slips in the blood of the suicide. Terror-struck,
he inquires whence it comes, and then
espies the corpse. On learning whose it is, he
mourns the loss of his dead favourite and discusses
the question of suicide with Tigellinus, who is
described in the <i>dramatis personæ</i> as "a young
Roman." Herod is shaken by fears, he feels a
cold wind when there is no wind, and hears "in
the air something that is like the beating of
wings." He devotes his attention to Salomé,
who slights all his advances. Once the voice of
Jokanaan is heard prophesying that the hour is
at hand, and Herodias angrily orders that he
should be silenced. Herod feebly upholds the
prophet and strenuously maintains that he is not
afraid of him as Herodias declares he is. She
then inquires why, that being the case, he does
not deliver him into the hands of the Jews, a
suggestion that is at once taken up by one of
the Jews present; and then follows a discussion
between Pharisees and Sadducees and Nazarenes
respecting the new Messiah. This is followed
by a dialogue between Herodias and the Tetrarch,
interrupted ever and again by the hollow-sounding
denunciations and prophecies of Jokanaan.</p>

<p>Herod's mind is still filled with the thoughts
of his stepdaughter and he beseeches Salomé to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
dance for him, but supported by her mother
she keeps on refusing. The chorus, in the person
of soldiers, once again draws attention to the
sombre aspect of the Tetrarch. More prophecies
from Jokanaan follow, with comments from
Herod and his wife.</p>

<p>Once more the watching soldiers remark on the
gloom and menace of the despot's countenance
and he himself confesses that he is sad, beseeching
his wife's child to dance for him, in return for
which favour he will give her all she may ask of
him, even unto the half of his kingdom. Salomé
snatches greedily at the bait and, in spite of her
mother's reiterated protests, obtains from Herod
an oath that he will grant her whatsoever she
wishes if she but dance for him. Even in the
midst of the joy with which her acceptance fills
him, the shadow of approaching death is over
him, he feels an icy wind, hears the rustle of
passing wings, and feels a hot breath and the
sensation of choking. The red petals of his rose
garland seem to him drops of blood, and yet
he tries to delude himself that he is perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>In accordance with Salomé's instructions,
slaves bring her perfumes and the seven veils
and remove her sandals. Even as Herod gloats
over the prospect of seeing her moving, naked
feet, he recalls the fact that she will be dancing
in blood and notes that the moon has turned red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
even as the prophet foretold. Herodias mocks
at him and taunts him with cowardice, endeavouring,
at the same time, to persuade him to
retire, but her appeals are interrupted by the
voice of Jokanaan. The sound of his voice
irritates her and she insists on going within, but
Herod is obstinate, he will not go till Salomé has
danced. She appeals once more to her daughter
not to dance, but with an "I am ready, Tetrarch,"
Salomé dances "the dance of the seven veils."
There are no stage directions given as to how
the dance is to be performed, but whoever has seen
the slow, rhythmic, and lascivious movements
of an Eastern dance can well imagine it and all
the passionate subtlety and exquisite grace with
which this languorous daughter of Judæan kings
would endow it. The ballet master who could
not seize this opportunity of devising a <i>pas de
fascination</i> worthy of the occasion does not
know the rudiments of his art.</p>

<p>Herod is filled with delight and admiration.
He is anxious to fulfil his pledge and bids Salomé
draw near and name her reward. She does so.
Her guerdon shall be the head of Jokanaan on a
silver charger. At this, Herodias is filled with
satisfaction, but the Tetrarch protests. Again
Herodias expresses approval and Herod begs
Salomé not to heed her. Proudly the dancer
answers that she does not heed her mother, that
it is for her own pleasure she demands the grisly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
reward, and reminds her stepfather of his oath.
He does not repudiate it but begs of her to
choose something else, even the half of his
kingdom rather than what she asks. Salomé
insists, and Herodias chimes in with a recital
of the insults she had suffered at the hands of
Jokanaan and is peremptorily bidden to be silent
by her husband, who argues with Salomé as to
the terrible and improper nature of her request,
offering her his great round emerald in place of
the head. But Salomé is obdurate. "I demand
the head of Jokanaan," she insists.</p>

<p>Herod wishes to speak, but she interrupts him
with "The head of Jokanaan." Again Herod
pleads with her and offers her fifty of his peacocks
whose backs are stained with gold and
their feet stained with purple, but she sullenly
reiterates&mdash;"Give me the head of Jokanaan."</p>

<p>Herodias once more expresses approval, and
her husband turns savagely on her with "Be
silent! You cry out always; you cry out like
a beast of prey." Then, his conscience stinging
him, he pleads for Jokanaan's life, and gives
vent to pious sentiments: he talks of the omnipresence
of God, and then is uncertain of it.
His mind is torn with doubts, and fears. He
has slipped in blood and heard a beating of wings
which are evil omens. Yet another appeal to
Salomé is met with the uncompromising "Give
me the head of Jokanaan." He makes one last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
appeal, he enumerates his treasures, jewels hidden
away that Herodias even has never seen; he
describes the precious stones in his treasury.
All these he offers her. He will add cups of
gold that if any enemy pour poison into them
will turn to silver, sandals encrusted with glass,
mantles from the land of the Seres, bracelets
from the City of Euphrates; nay even the mantle
of the High Priest shall she have, the very veil
of the Temple. Above the angry protests of
the Jews rises Salomé's "Give me the head of
Jokanaan," and sinking back into his seat the
weak man gives way and hands the ring of death
to a soldier, who straightway bears it to the
executioner. As soon as his scared official has
disappeared into the cistern Salomé leans over it
and listens. She is quivering with excitement
and is indignant that there is no sound of a
struggle. She calls to Naaman to strike. There
is no answer&mdash;she can hear nothing. Then there
is the sound ... something has fallen on the
ground. She fancies it is the executioner's sword
and that he is afraid to carry out his task. She
bids the page order the soldiers to bring her the
head. He recoils from her and she turns to the
men themselves bidding them carry out the
sentence. They likewise recoil, and just as she
turns to Herod himself with a demand for the
head, a huge black arm is extended from the
cistern presenting the head of Jokanaan on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
silver shield. She seizes it eagerly. Meanwhile
the cowering Tetrarch covers his face with his
cloak and a smile of triumph illumines the face
of Herodias. All the tigress in Salomé is
awakened; she apostrophises the head. He
would not let her kiss his mouth. Well, she
will kiss it now, she will fasten her teeth in it.
She twits the eyes and the tongue with their
present impotence, she will throw the head to
the dogs and the birds of the air. But anon her
mood changes, she recalls all that in him had
appealed to her, and laments over the fact that,
though she loves him still, her desire for him can
now never be appeased.</p>

<p>All Herod's superstitious fears are awakened,
he upbraids Herodias for her daughter's crime,
and mounts the staircase to enter the palace.
The stage darkens and Salomé, a moonbeam
falling on her, is heard apostrophising the head,
the lips of which she has just kissed. Herod
turns, and, seeing her, orders her to be killed,
and the soldiers, rushing forward, crush her with
their shields.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the dramatist has awarded
the fate meted out in Scripture to Herodias to
the daughter and not the mother, a poetic licence
for which no one will blame him.</p>

<p>In reading the play carefully and critically
one cannot but be struck with the influence of
Maeterlinck in the atmosphere and construction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and of Flaubert in the gorgeous imagery of the
dialogue, the <i>décor des phrases</i>, so to speak.
An artist in words Wilde also proves himself
in stagecraft in this play. Not the mere
mechanical setting, of which I shall speak later,
but the ability to lead up to a situation, the
power to convey a whole volume in a few words
to fill the audience with a sense of impending
tragedy, and to utilise outside influences to
enhance the value of the scenes. Thus, the
references to the moon by the various characters
are so many stage settings for the emotion of the
moment, verbal pictures illustrating the state of
mind of the speaker, or the trend of the action.
It has been objected that the constant reiteration
of a given phrase is a mere trick and Max Nordau
has set it down as a mark of insanity, but in the
hands of an artist the use of that "trick" incalculably
enhances the value of the dialogue,
although when employed by a bungler the repetition
would be as senseless and irritating
as the conversational remarks of a parrot. The
young Syrian's admiration for Salomé, the page's
fears and warnings, Salomé's insistence that she
will kiss Jokanaan's mouth, later on her insistence
on having his head, the very comments of
the soldiers on Herod's sombre look are all
brought in with a thoroughly definite purpose,
and it would be difficult to find an equally
simple and effective way of achieving that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
purpose.</p>

<p>A favourite device of the author was to introduce,
apparently casually, a sentence or word
at the beginning of the play to be repeated or
used with telling effect at the end. For instance,
in "A Woman Of No Importance" Lord Illingworth's
casual remark&mdash;"Oh, no one&mdash;a woman
of no importance," which brings down the curtain
on the first act, is used with a slight alteration at
the end of the play in Mrs Arbuthnot's reply to
Gerald's inquiry as to who her visitor has been,
"Ah, no one&mdash;a man of no importance." In the
same way Salomé's reiterated cry, "I will kiss
the mouth of Jokanaan," in her scene with the
prophet gives added strength to her bitterly
triumphant cry as, holding the severed head in
her hands, she repeats at three different intervals,
"I have kissed thy mouth, Jokanaan."</p>

<p>Apart from all questions of stage technique,
Wilde had the incomparable gift of finding <i>le
mot juste</i>, of conveying a portrait in half-a-dozen
words. Could anything give one a more
distinct portrait of Herod than Salomé's description
of his "mole's eyes under his shaking
eyelids," or would it be possible to explain Herod's
passion for his stepdaughter in fewer words than
her soliloquy: "It is strange that the husband of
my mother looks at me like that. I know not
what it means. In truth, yes, I know it." There
is not a word wasted or misplaced, there is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
superfluous syllable.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the influence of Flaubert or
his language, but there was in Wilde a thoroughly
Eastern love of colour which found its expression
in sensuous richness of sound, jewelled words,
wonderfully employed to effect a contrast with
the horror in which he seemed to take a strange
delight. The rich, decorative phrases only enhance
the constant presence of the weird and
<i>macabre</i>, while in its turn the horror gives an
almost painful lustre to the words.</p>

<p>The play has been assailed as immoral, but this
certainly is not so. The setting of an Eastern
drama is not that of a Western, and the morals
and customs of the East are no more to be
judged by a Western standard than the Court
of Herod to be compared with that of Edward
the Seventh.</p>

<p>The play deals frankly with a sensuous episode,
and if the author has introduced the proper atmosphere
he is only doing in words what every
artist does in painting. Compare "Salomé" with
Shakespeare's one Eastern play, "Cleopatra," and
though the treatment may be a little more
modern, a trifle more decadent, the same non-morality
rather than immorality is to be found
in the principal characters.</p>

<p>I fancy that a great deal of the prejudice still
existing in England against the play is due to
the illustrations of the late Aubrey Beardsley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Beardsley was a personal friend of mine, and it,
therefore, pains me to have to frankly confess
that, clever and decorative as his drawings undoubtedly
are, they are unhealthy in this instance,
unhealthy and evil in suggestion. I can imagine
no more pruriently horrible nightmare than these
pictures of foul-faced, satyrlike men, feminine
youths and leering women. The worst of
Beardsley's women is that, in spite of their
lubricity, they grow on one, and now and then
one suddenly traces in their features a likeness
to really good women one has known. It is as
though something Satanic had been worked into
the ripe-lipped face of a girl. Such as these might
have been the emissaries of Satan who tempted
anchorites of old to commit unpardonable sins.
Moreover, many of the illustrations have nothing
whatever to do with the text. I may be wrong,
but I cannot for the life of me see what connection
there is between "Salomé," the play, and
"The Peacock Skirt" or "The Black Cape." Nor
can I see the object of modernising the "Stomach
Dance," save to impart an extra dose of lubricity
into the subject. The <i>leit motif</i> of all
Beardsley's art was to <i>epater les bourgeois</i>, to
horrify the ordinary stolid Philistine, and he
would hesitate at nothing, however <i>outré</i>, to
attain this end. In these drawings he surpassed
himself in that respect, and one can only wonder
that a publisher was found daring enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
publish them. The subject is a painful one to
me, but I should not have been doing my duty
as a critic of the play had I not remarked upon
it. An edition from which the drawings are
omitted can, however, be bought to-day.</p>

<p>I have already commented on the vagueness
of the directions as to the setting of the scene,
and it may not be out of place to quote here a
letter I have received from a well-known stage-manager
on the subject. "You ask me how I
would set the scene in question in accordance
with the printed directions, and I reply frankly
that I should be puzzled to do so even were the
scene to consist of the banqueting hall with the
balustraded terrace built up above it. The whole
action of the piece takes place on the terrace,
from which the actors are supposed to overlook
the banqueting hall, so that the latter apartment
need not be in view of the audience, but the
gigantic staircase on the <i>R.</i> I confess fogs me.
Where does it lead to, and, save for Herod's exit
at the end of the play, of what use is it? It
only lumbers up the stage, and looks out of place
(to my mind, at anyrate) on a terrace.</p>

<p>"By the cistern I presume the author means a
well, though how on earth the actor who plays
Jokanaan is going to manage to scramble in
and out of it with dignity so as not to provoke
the hilarity of the audience is beyond my ken. I
note that in the production of the opera at Dresden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the printed directions were utterly ignored."</p>

<p>As has already been stated, "Salomé" was
first written in French and subsequently translated
into English by a friend of Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>Reading it in the language in which it was
originally written, one fact stands out pre-eminent&mdash;the
work is that of a foreigner. The
French, though correct and polished, is not virile,
living French. It is too correct, too laboured;
the writer does not take any liberties with his
medium. The words have all the delicacy of
marble statuary but lack the breath of life. I
think it was Max Beerbohm who once said of
Walter Pater (heaven forbid that I should agree
with him) that he wrote English as though it
were a dead language, and that is precisely what
is the matter with Wilde's French. One longs
for a <i>tournure de phrase</i>, a <i>maniement de mots</i> that
would give it a semblance of native authorship.
It is like a Russian talking French, and altogether
too precise, too pedantically grammatical.</p>

<p>I believe the play was revised by Marcel
Schwab, but although he may have corrected
an error here and there he would hardly have
liked to tamper with the text itself.</p>

<p>The play was written in 1892, and was accepted
by Madame Sarah Bernhardt, who was to have
produced it during her season at the Palace
Theatre. It was already in full rehearsal when
it was prohibited by the Censor. A great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of abuse and ridicule has been heaped on that
official for this, but in all fairness to him it must
be admitted that he had no choice in the matter.
Rightly or wrongly plays dealing with Biblical
subjects are not allowed to be performed on the
English stage, and the Censor's business is to see
that the rules and regulations governing stage
productions are duly observed.</p>

<p>The author was greatly incensed at the refusal
of the Lord Chamberlain's officer to license the
piece, and talked (whether seriously or not is a
moot point) of leaving England for ever and
taking out naturalisation papers as a French
citizen. This threat he never carried out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame Sarah Bernhardt had
taken the play back to Paris with her, promising
to produce it at her own theatre of the Porte
St Martin at the very first opportunity, a promise
that was never fulfilled. Moreover, when a
couple of years later Wilde, then a prisoner
awaiting his trial, finding himself penniless, sent
a friend to her to explain how he was circumstanced,
and offering to sell her the play outright
for a comparatively small sum of money in order
that he might be able to pay for his defence, this
incomparable <i>poseuse</i> was profuse in her expressions
of sympathy and admiration for <i>ce grand
artiste</i> and promised to assist him to the best of
her ability. She had the cruelty to delude with
false hopes a man suffering a mental martyrdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and after buoying him up from day to day with
promises of financial assistance, the Jewess not
considering the investment a remunerative one,
shut the door to his emissary, and failed to keep
her word. Now that the foreign royalties on
play and opera amount to a considerable sum
annually her Hebrew heart must be consumed
with rage at having missed such "a good thing."</p>

<p>The piece was first produced at the Théâtre
Libre in Paris in 1896 by Monsieur Luigne Poë
with Lina Muntz as Salomé. The news of the
production reached Wilde in his prison cell at
Reading, and in a letter to a friend the following
reference to it occurs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Please say how gratified I was at the performance
of my play, and have my thanks conveyed
to Luigne Poë. It is something that at
a time of disgrace and shame I should still be
regarded as an artist. I wish I could feel more
pleasure, but I seem dead to all emotions except
those of anguish and despair. However, please
let Luigne Poë know I am sensible of the honour
he has done me. He is a poet himself. Write
to me in answer to this, and try and see what
Lemaitre, Bauer, and Sarcey said of 'Salomé.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something intensely pathetic in the
picture of Convict 33 writing to know what the
foremost critics of the most artistic city in Europe
have to say concerning the child of his brain.</p>

<p>The play was eventually privately produced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
English by the New Stage Club in May 1905 at

<p>The following paragraphs are taken from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
criticism on the performance which appeared in
<i>The Daily Chronicle</i> of 11th May 1905:</p>

<blockquote><p>"If only the dazzling and unfortunate genius
who wrote 'Salomé' could have seen it acted as
it was acted yesterday at the little Bijou Theatre!
One fears, if he had, he would have found that
little phrase of his&mdash;'the importance of being
earnest'&mdash;a more delicately true satire than
ever upon our sometimes appalling seriousness.</p>

<p>"Quite a brilliant and crowded audience
had responded to what seemed an undoubtedly
daring and interesting venture. Many seemed
to have come out of mere curiosity to see a play
the censor had forbidden; some through knowing
what a beautiful, passionate, and in its real
altitude wholly inoffensive play 'Salomé' is.</p>

<p>"As those who had read the play were aware,
this was in no way the fault of the author of
'Salomé.' Its offence in the censor's eyes&mdash;and,
considering the average audience, he was doubtless
wise&mdash;was that it represents Salomé making
love to John the Baptist, failing to win him to
her desires, and asking for his death from Herod,
as revenge. This, of course, is not Biblical, but
is a fairly widespread tradition.</p>

<p>"In the play, as it is written, this love scene
is just a very beautiful piece of sheer passionate
speech, full of luxurious, Oriental imagery, much
of which is taken straight from the 'Song of
Solomon.' It is done very cleverly, very gracefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
It is not religious, but it is, in itself,
neither blasphemous nor obscene, whatever it
may be in the ears of those who hear it. It
might possibly, perhaps, be acted grossly; acted
naturally and beautifully it would show itself at
least art.</p>

<p>"In the hands, however, of the New Stage
Club it was treated after neither of these
methods. It was treated solemnly, dreamily,
phlegmatically, as a sort of cross between
Maeterlinck and a 'mystery play.'</p>

<p>"The whole of the play was done in this
manner, all save two parts&mdash;one, that of Herodias
(Miss Salom), which was excellently and vigorously
played: the other, that of Herod, which
was completely spoiled by an actor who gave
what appeared to be a sort of semi-grotesque
portrait of one of the late Roman emperors.
Even the play itself represents the usurping
Idumean as a terrific figure of ignorant strength
and lustfulness and power 'walking mightily in
his greatness.' Some of the most luxurious
speeches in the whole play&mdash;above all the
wonderful description of his jewels&mdash;are put into
Herod's mouth. Yet he is represented at the
Bijou Theatre as a doddering weakling! And
even so is desperately serious.</p>

<p>"Altogether, beneath this pall of solemnity on
the one hand and lack of real exaltation on the
other, the play's beauties of speech and thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
had practically no chance whatever. Set as it is
too, in one long act of an hour and a half, the
lack of natural life and vigour made it more tiresome
still. And the shade of Oscar Wilde will
doubtless be blamed for it all!"</p></blockquote>

<p>It was unavoidable that a play necessitating
the highest histrionic ability on the part of the
actors, together with the greatest delicacy of
touch and artistic sense of proportion, should
suffer in its interpretation by a set of amateurs,
however enthusiastic.</p>

<p>A second performance, given in June 1906 by
the Literary Stage Society, was far more successful
from an artistic point of view. This was in a
great measure due to the admirable stage setting
designed by one who is an artist to his finger tips,
Mr C. S. Ricketts, and who, having been a
personal friend of the author's, could enter
thoroughly into the spirit of the play. The
scene was laid in Herod's tent, the long blue
folds of which, with a background curtain
spangled with silver stars, set off to perfection
the exquisite Eastern costumes designed by the
same authority. Mr Robert Farquharson was
the Herod and Miss Darragh the Salomé.</p>

<p>But even this performance was far from being
up to the standard the play demands, and Dr
Max Meyerfeld, who has done so much to make
Wilde's work known in Germany, wrote of it:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The most notable feature of the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of 'Salomé' was the costumes, designed by Mr
C. S. Ricketts&mdash;a marvellous harmony of blue
and green and silver. Here praise must end.
The stage was left ridiculously bare, and never
for a moment produced the illusion of the terrace
outside Herod's banqueting hall. Not even the
cistern out of which the Prophet rises was discoverable&mdash;Hamlet
without the Prince of Denmark.
And the actors! Without being too
exigeant, I cannot but suggest that before attempting
such a play they ought to have been
sent by a special train to Berlin. Even then
Miss Darragh would have been an impossible
Salomé. She lacked nearly everything required
by this complex character. The Dance of the
Seven Veils was executed with all the propriety
of a British governess. Mr Robert Farquharson,
whose Herod delighted us last year, has now
elaborated it to the verge of caricature. He emphasises
far too much the neuropathic element,
and revels in the repulsive symptoms of incipient
softening of the brain.</p>

<p>"I cannot think that either of these works has
yet been given a fair chance in England. They
are, however, things which will endure, being
independent of place and time, of dominant
prejudice and caprices of taste."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the Continent "Salomé" has become almost
a stock piece and has been performed in France,
Sweden, Holland, Italy, and Russia, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
been translated into every European tongue. It
was not, however, till the production in February,
1905, of the opera of Richard Strauss at the
Royal Opera House, Dresden, that "Salomé"
occupied its true and proper place in the art
world. Admirably rendered into German by
Madame Hedwig Lachmann, the libretto is a
faithful translation of the original text. The
success of the opera was not for a minute in
doubt, and with operatic stars of the first order
to interpret the characters and an orchestra of
110 performers to do full justice to the instrumental
music, nothing was left undone to make
the production a memorable one. A distinguished
foreign critic writing from Dresden says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Death in Love, and Love in Death, that is
the whole piece. Death of Narraboth, the young
captain who cannot bear the burning words that
Salomé addresses to Iokanaan; death of Iokanaan.
Death of Salomé, impending death of
Herod Antipas," and analysing the character of
Salomé he continues: "It is not the Jewess 'so
charming and full of touching humility' that
Salomé represents, she is the Syrian who inspired
the Song of Songs, for whom incest is almost a
law and Semiramius, Lath, and Myrrha divinities.
She is the Syrian a prey to the seven devils, who
combines in her amorous cult beauty, death, and
resurrection."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the opera was performed at Berlin it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
interesting to remember that the Kaiser, whose
views on morality are strict enough to satisfy the
most exacting Puritan, far from seeing anything
to object to in the story, not only was present
on the opening night, but took an active interest
in the rehearsals, going so far even as to suggest
certain mechanical effects.</p>

<p>In New York a perfect storm of execration
from the "ultra guid" greeted the production of
Strauss's work, which was almost immediately
withdrawn. It is only justice to say that the
rendering of the Dance of the Seven Veils was
in a great measure responsible for this.</p>

<p>It was also freely rumoured that the puritanical
daughter of one of the millionaire
directors of the Opera House had used her
influence for the suppression of the new production.</p>

<p>It is interesting to hear what the objectors to
the story have to say, and with this view I quote
two extracts, one from a letter written by Mr E.
A. Baughan to <i>The Musical Standard</i> and the
other from a well-known critic writing in a leading
provincial paper.</p>

<p>Mr Baughan writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Oscar Wilde took nothing but the characters
and the incident of John the Baptist's head
being brought in a charger. All else is changed
and bears no relation to the Bible story. That
would not matter had worthy use been made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the story.</p>

<p>"In 'Salomé' everything is twisted to create
an atmosphere of eroticism and sensuality. That
is the aim of the play and nothing else. There
is none of the 'wide bearing on life' which you
vaguely suggest. Herod is a sensuous beast who
takes delight in the beautiful postures of his stepdaughter.
He speaks line after line of highly
coloured imagery and his mental condition is
that of a man on the verge of delirium tremens,
brought on by drink and satyriasis. Oscar
Wilde does not make him 'sorry' but only
slightly superstitious, thus losing whatever of
drama there is in the Bible narrative.</p>

<p>"So far, and in the drawing of Herodias, the
dramatist may be allowed the licence he has taken,
however. Even a Puritan must admit that art
must show the evil as well as the good of life to
present a perfect whole.</p>

<p>"But it is in the character of Salomé herself
that Oscar Wilde has succeeded in his aim of
shocking any man or woman of decent mind.
He makes Salomé in love with John the Baptist.
It is a horrible, decadent, lascivious love. She
prates of his beautiful smooth limbs and the cold,
passionless lips which he will not yield to her insensate
desire. It is a picture of unnatural passion,
all the more terrible that Salomé is a young
girl. John the Baptist's death is brought about
as much by Salomé as her mother. The prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
will not yield himself alive to Salomé's desires,
but she can, and does, feed her passion at his
dead, cold lips. And that is what has disgusted
New York.</p>

<p>"You speak of fighting for liberty in art.
If such exhibitions of degraded passion are included
in what you call 'liberty,' then you will
be fighting for the representation on the stage of
satyriasis and nymphomania, set forth with every
imaginable circumstance of literary and musical
skill. I can conceive of no greater degradation
of Richard Strauss's genius than the illustration
of this play by music."</p></blockquote>

<p>And here is what the critic of the provincial
journals has to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Salomé marks the depths of all that was
spurious, all that was artificial, all that was
perverse. Startling to English ears, the play
was not at all original. It drew its inspiration
from the decadent school of France, but in that
world it would rank as one of the commonplace.</p>

<p>"The shocking, startling idea, that so outraged
the respectable Yankees, is the twisting of a
story of the New Testament to the needs of a
literature of the most degenerate kind. But in
Paris, and particularly amongst Wilde's friends,
all such ideas had lost the thrill of novelty.
Pierre Louys, to whom he dedicates the book,
had couched his own 'Aphrodite' on similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
perversions of history and mythology, and to
treat the story of the New Testament in similar
fashion was hardly likely to give pause to men
who laughed at the basis of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>"Even Academicians like Anatole France
dealt with the Gospels as the mere framework of
ironical stories, and writers of the stamp of Jean
Loverain out-Heroded Wilde's Herod both in
audacity and point. Catulle Mendes recently
produced at the Opera House in Paris an opera
founded on the supposed love of Mary Magdalen
for Christ. Catulle Mendes has very real talent,
the opera was a great success."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever the judgment of posterity may be,
and there can be little doubt that it can be
favourable, the play must ever appeal to the
actor, the artist, and the student of literature, on
account of its dramatic possibilities, its wonderful
colouring, the perfection of its construction,
and the mastery of its style.</p>

<p>It stands alone in the literature of all countries.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DUCHESS_OF_PADUA" id="THE_DUCHESS_OF_PADUA"></a>"THE DUCHESS OF PADUA"</h2>


<p>The first of all Wilde's plays was "The Duchess
of Padua." It was written at the time when
he was living at the Hotel Voltaire in Paris
and taking Balzac as his model. The title of the
play was doubtless inspired by Webster's gloomy
tragedy of another Italian duchess; and the play
itself is in five acts. Although many students of
his works consider that it is worthy to rank with
the masterpieces of the Elizabethan drama, it
must be confessed that the work, though full of
promise, is immature and too obviously indebted
in certain scenes to some of Shakespeare's most
obvious stage tricks. He had written the play
with a view to its being played by Miss Mary
Anderson, but to his great disappointment she
declined his offer of it.</p>

<p>His biographer's description of his reception
of her refusal is worth quoting:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was with him at the Hotel Voltaire on
the day when he heard from Mary Anderson, to
whom he had sent a copy of the drama which
was written for her. He telegraphed in the
morning for her decision, and whilst we were
talking together after lunch her answer came.
It was unfavourable; yet, though he had founded
great hopes on the production of this play, he
gave no sign of his disappointment. I can remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
his tearing a little piece off the blue
telegraph-form and rolling it up into a pellet and
putting it into his mouth, as, by a curious habit,
he did with every paper or book that came into
his hands. And all he said, as he passed the
telegram over to me, was, 'This, Robert, is
rather tedious.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The scene opens in the market, where Ascanio
and Guido are awaiting the arrival of the writer
of a letter who has promised to enlighten the
latter as to his birth, and who will wear a violet
cloak with a silver falcon embroidered on the
shoulder. The stranger arrives and proves to be
Count Moranzone, who, Ascanio having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
dismissed, informs the lad that he is the son of
Lorenzo, the late Duke of Padua, betrayed to
an ignominious death by the reigning Duke,
Simone Gesso. He works on the youth's feelings
and induces him to swear to avenge his
father's death by slaying his betrayer, but not
until Moranzone sends him his parent's dagger.
Guido left alone, in a fine speech renews his oath,
and as he is vowing on his drawn dagger to
"forswear the love of women and that hollow
bauble men call female loveliness," Beatrice
descends the steps of the church, their eyes meet
for a second and as she leaves the stage she turns to
look at him again. "Say, who is yonder lady?"
inquires the young man, and a burgher answers,
"The Duchess of Padua."</p>

<p>In the second act the Duchess is seen pleading
with her husband that he should feed and assist
his starving people. On his exit she is joined by
Guido, who, for the first time, declares his love,
while she avows hers in turn. A pretty love
scene full of tenderness and poetry is interrupted
by the appearance of Count Moranzone, whom
Beatrice alone catches sight of, and presently a
messenger enters and hands Guido a parcel containing
the fatal dagger. He will have no more
to do with love&mdash;for will not his soul be stained
with murder?&mdash;and steeling his heart against
Beatrice he bids her farewell, telling her that there
is a barrier between them. The Duke makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
brief entrance. The Duchess will not go hunting
with him. He suspects, and inquires for
Guido, and with a veiled threat leaves her. She
will end her life that very night, she soliloquises,
and yet, why should she die, why not the
Duke?</p>

<p>She is interrupted by Moranzone, whom she
taxes with taking Guido from her. He answers
that the young man does not love her nor will
she ever see him more, and leaves her. She
determines that that very night she will lie in
Death's arms.</p>

<p>The third act takes place at night within the
Palace. Guido enters the apartment from without
by means of a rope ladder, and is met by Moranzone,
to whom he declares that he will not
stoop to murder, but will place the dagger, with
a paper stating who he is, upon the Duke's bed
and then take horse to Venice and enlist
against the Infidels. Nothing Moranzone urges
can move him and the latter at last leaves
him.</p>

<p>As Guido lifts the curtain to enter the Duke's
chamber he is met by Beatrice, who, after a
while, confesses that she has stabbed her husband.
Guido, horrified, refuses to have aught to do with
her, and despite all her blandishments and entreaties
remains adamant. She then begs him
to draw his sword on her "and quick make
reckoning with Death, who yet licks his lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
after this feast."</p>

<p>He wrests the dripping knife from her hand,
and although she explains that 'twas for love of
him she did the deed he bids her begone to her
chamberwomen.</p>

<p>Finally she turns on him with the threat
"Who of us calls down the lightning on his
head let him beware the hurt that lurks within
the forked levin's flame," she leaves him. Left
alone, his heart goes forth to her and he calls her
back, but soon her voice is heard without, saying,
"This way fled my husband's murderer."
Soldiers enter, and Guido is arrested, the bloodstained
knife being taken from him.</p>

<p>The fourth act is laid in the hall of justice.
The Duchess has accused Guido of the murder.
He will not defend himself though Moranzone,
who has recognised the dagger as the Duchess's,
urges him to do so. Guido tells his evil genius
that he himself did the deed. He then begs
leave of the Justiciar to let him name the guilty
one who slew the Duke, but Beatrice, who is
fearful he will accuse her, urges that he shall not
be allowed speech. A lengthy wrangle takes
place between her, the judges, and Moranzone,
and the court retires to consider the point. During
the interval, the accused holds conference
with the Cardinal, who will only hear him in the
Confessional. Beatrice tells him, "An thou dost
meet my husband in Purgatory with a blood-red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
star over his heart, tell him I send you to bear
him company." When at last the judges return
they decide that Guido may have speech.
Beatrice, who has arranged for a horse to be
in waiting that it may convey her to Venice,
endeavours to leave the court, but is prevented.
At last Guido speaks and confesses to the
murder. He is condemned to death, and is led
forth as Beatrice, calling out his name, "throws
wide her arms and rushes across the stage
towards him."</p>

<p>The last act takes place in the prison. Guido
is asleep, and Beatrice, wearing a cloak and mask,
enters to him. By wearing these and using her
ring of State she hopes he will be enabled to
escape. Presently she drinks the poison which,
as he is of noble birth, has been placed near him
and when he awakes a reconciliation takes place
between them. It is too late, the poison has
begun to work. "Oh, Beatrice, thy mouth
wears roses that do defy Death," exclaims
Guido, and later on&mdash;"Who sins for love,
sins not," to which Beatrice replies, "I have
sinned, and yet mayhap shall I be forgiven. I
have loved much." They kiss each other for
the first time in this act, and in a final spasm
she expires, and he, snatching the dagger from
her belt, stabs himself as the executioner
enters.</p>

<p>The play was read for copyright purposes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
March, 1907, by an amateur dramatic society
connected with St James's Church, Hampstead
Road, Mr George Alexander, lending his theatre
for the purpose. It has been produced, but without
much success, in America by Miss Gale and
the late Lawrence Barrett, and in 1904 at one
of the leading theatres in Hamburg. The
German production was, however, marred by a
series of unfortunate incidents, so that it can
hardly be held to have been a fair test of the
merits of the play. The Guido had a severe cold,
and during Beatrice's long speech in the last act,
when he is supposed to be asleep, kept on spoiling
the situation by repeated sneezes, while the
Duchess herself was uncertain of her words.
On the third night the Cardinal went mad
on the stage and had to be taken off to an
asylum.</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Padua" is much more a
play for the study than the stage, although replete
with dramatic possibilities, for its gloomy
character would always militate against its
success in this country. The plot is finely
elaborated, and yet perfectly clear. The characterisation
is keenly aware of the value of
contrast in art and packed with a psychology
which, buried as it is, nevertheless is just and
accurate. No one can read the truly poetical
dialogue with its stately cadence and rich volume
of sound without being moved by the dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of tragedy, and what blemishes there may be are
more due to inexperience than to any departure
from the ideals in art that the author had set
up for himself.</p>

<p class="center">Scene, Moscow. Time, 1800.</p>


<p>The plot is briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dmitri Sabouroff, the son of an innkeeper, is,
with other prisoners, on his way to an exile in
Siberia to which he has been sentenced for participation
in Nihilist conspiracies. The band of
prisoners in its melancholy progress halts at the
paternal inn. Dmitri is recognised by his sister
Vera, and manages to pass her a piece of paper
on which is written the address of the Nihilist
centre, together with the form of oath used on
joining. Then the old innkeeper recognises his
son and tries to get to him as the prisoners are
being marched off. The colonel in charge of the
detachment (Kotemkin), closes the door on him
and the old man falls senseless to the ground.
A peasant admirer of Vera's (Michael) kneels
down and tends the stricken father while Vera
recites the oath: "To strangle whatever nature
is in me; neither to love nor to be loved; neither
to pity nor to be pitied; neither to marry nor to
be given in marriage, till the end is come."
This tableau ends the prologue.</p>

<p>In the first act the Nihilists are assembled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
their secret meeting place and are anxiously
waiting the return of Vera, who has gone to a
ball at the Grand Duke's to "see the Czar and
all his cursed brood face to face."</p>

<p>Amongst the conspirators is a young student
of medicine, Alexis, who has incurred the suspicions
of Vera's admirer, Michael, the most
uncompromising of the revolutionists. Vera
returns with the news that martial law is to be
proclaimed. She is in love with Alexis and
reproves him for running the risk of being
present. Meanwhile, Michael and the President
confer together. Michael proposes to don the
uniform of the Imperial Guard, make his way
into the courtyard of the palace, and shoot the
Czar as he attends a council to be held in a room,
the exact location of which he has learnt from
Alexis. He has followed Alexis and seen him
enter the palace, but has not seen the young man
come out again though he had waited all night
upon the watch.</p>

<p>Vera defends Alexis whom the conspirators
wish to kill. Suddenly soldiers are heard outside,
the conspirators resume their masks as
Kotemkin and his men enter. In reply to his
inquiries Vera informs him that they are a
company of strolling players. He orders her
to unmask. Alexis steps forward, removes his
mask, and proclaims himself to be the Czarevitch!
The conspirators fear he will betray them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
he backs up Vera's tale as to their being strolling
players, gives the officer to understand that he
has an affair of gallantry on hand with Vera, and
with a caution to the General dismisses him and
his men. The curtain comes down, as, turning
to the Nihilists, he exclaims, "Brothers, you trust
me now!"</p>

<p>The second act is laid in the Council Chamber,
where the various councillors are assembled, including
the cynical Prime Minister, Prince Paul
Maraloffski. Presently the Czarevitch enters,
followed later by the Czar, whose fears Prince
Paul has worked on to induce him to proclaim
martial law. He is about to sign the document
when the Czarevitch intervenes with a passionate
appeal for the people and their rights, and finally
proclaims himself a Nihilist. His father orders
his arrest, and his orders are about to be carried
out when a shot is heard from without and the
Czar, who has thrown open the window, falls
mortally wounded, and dies, denouncing his son
as his murderer.</p>

<p>The third act takes place in the Nihilists'
meeting place. Alexis has been proclaimed
Czar, and has dismissed his father's evil genius,
Prince Paul. The passwords are given and it is
discovered that there is a stranger present. He
unmasks, and proves to be no other than Prince
Paul, who desires to become a Nihilist and revenge
himself for his dismissal. Alexis has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
obeyed the summons to the meeting, and in spite
of Vera's protests is sentenced to death. The
implacable Michael reminds her of her brother's
fate and of her oath. She steels her heart and
demands to draw with the others for the honour
of carrying out the sentence on Alexis. It falls
to her, and it is arranged that she shall make her
way to the Czar's bedchamber that night, Paul
having provided the key and the password, and
stab him in his sleep. Once she has carried out
her mission she is to throw out the bloodstained
dagger to her fellow-conspirators, who will be
waiting outside, as a signal that the Czar has
been assassinated.</p>

<p>The fourth act is set in the antechamber of the
Czar's private room, where the various ministers
are assembled discussing the Czar and his plans of
reform (he has already dismissed his guards and
ordered the release of all political prisoners).</p>

<p>Alexis enters and listens to their conversation.
Stepping forward he dismisses them all, depriving
them of their fortunes and estates. Left alone
he falls asleep and Vera, entering, raises her hand
to stab him, when he awakes and seizes her arm.
He tells her he has only accepted the crown that
she should share it with him. Vera realises that
she loves him and that she has broken her oath.
A love scene follows. Midnight strikes, the
conspirators are heard clamouring in the streets.
Vera stabs herself, throws the dagger out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
window, and in answer to Alexis's agonised,
"What have you done?" replies with her dying
breath, "I have saved Russia."</p>

<p>The play, as I have already said, is quite
different from any other of Wilde's, and in reading
it one cannot help regretting that he did not
turn some of his attention and devote a portion
of his great talents to the reform of English
melodrama. He might have founded a strong,
virile, and healthy dramatic school, and by so
doing raised the standard of the popular everyday
play in this country. Nevertheless, that
"Vera" was not a success when produced is
not to be wondered at, apart from the fact of
its having been vilely acted. Pure melodrama,
especially, despite a very general idea to the
contrary, requires an acquaintance with technique
and stage mechanism that is only obtainable
after many years of practice. At this
period the author had not enjoyed this practice
in technique. Nevertheless, the play is essentially
dramatic and had Mr Wilde at this early
time in his dramatic career called in the assistance
of some experienced actor or stage-manager,
with a very little alteration a perfectly
workmanlike drama could have been
made out of it. The prologue and the first act
could have been run into one act divided into
two separate scenes. More incident and action
could have been introduced into Act Two and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
some of the dialogue curtailed. Acts Three and
Four want very little revision, and it would have
been easy to introduce one or two female
characters and perhaps a second love interest.
Some light-comedy love scenes would have
helped to redeem the gloom of the play and
afforded a valuable contrast to the intensity of
the hero and heroine in their amorous converse.</p>

<p>The dialogue is crisp and vigorous and the
language at times of rare beauty. It is a pity
that such a work should be wasted, and it is
to be hoped that some manager will have the
astuteness and ability to produce it in a good
acting form. The experiment would certainly
be worth trying.</p>

<p>The play as a whole is certainly not one of its
author's finest productions. As has been said, it
was written before he had mastered stage technique
and learned those secrets of dramaturgy
which in later years raised him to such a pinnacle
of fame as a dramatic author. Yet it can be
said of it with perfect confidence that it is far
and away superior to nine-tenths of modern, and
successful, melodramatic plays. Indeed, whenever
we discuss or criticise even the less important
works of Oscar Wilde we are amazed
at their craftsmanship and delighted with their
achievement. The most unconsidered trifles
from his pen stand out among similar productions
as the moon among stars, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
genius is so great that work for which other
writers would expect and receive the highest
praise in comparison with <i>his</i> greatest triumphs
almost fails to excite more than a fugitive and
passing admiration.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FLORENTINE_TRAGEDY" id="THE_FLORENTINE_TRAGEDY"></a>"THE FLORENTINE TRAGEDY"</h2>


<p>An interesting story attaches to "The Florentine
Tragedy," a short play by Wilde which was
produced on 18th June 1906, by the Literary
Theatre Club.</p>

<p>The history of the play was related by Mr
Robert Ross to a representative of <i>The Tribune</i>
newspaper.</p>

<p>"The play was written," he said, "for Mr
George Alexander, but for certain reasons was
not produced by him. In April 1895, Mr
Wilde requested me to go to his house and take
possession of all his unpublished manuscripts.
He had been declared a bankrupt, and I reached
the house just before the bailiffs entered. Of
course, the author's letters and manuscripts of
two other unpublished plays and the enlarged
version of 'The Portrait of Mr W. H.' upon
which I knew he was engaged&mdash;had mysteriously
disappeared. Someone had been there before
me.</p>

<p>"The thief was never discovered, nor have we
ever seen 'The Florentine Tragedy,' the 'Mr
W. H.' story, or one of the other plays, 'The
Duchess of Padua'&mdash;since that time. Curiously
enough, the manuscript of the third play, a
tragedy somewhat on the lines of 'Salomé,' was
discovered by a friend of Mr Wilde's in a secondhand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
bookshop in London, in 1897. It was sent
to the author in Paris, and was not heard of
again. After his death in 1900 it could not be
found. With regard to 'The Duchess of Padua,'
the loss was not absolute, for this play, a five-act
tragedy, had previously been performed in
America, and I possessed the 'prompt' copy.</p>

<p>"To return to 'The Florentine Tragedy.' I
had heard portions of it read, and was acquainted
with the incidents and language, but for a long
time I gave it up as lost. Then, after Mr
Wilde's death, I had occasion to sort a mass of
letters and papers which were handed to me by
his solicitors. Among them I found loose sheets
containing the draft of a play which I recognised
as 'The Florentine Tragedy.' By piecing these
together I was able to reconstruct a considerable
portion of the play. The first five pages had
gone, and there was another page missing, but
some 400 lines of blank verse remained. Now
the introductory scene of the single act of which
the play consists has been rewritten by Mr
Sturge Moore, and the 'Tragedy' will be presented
to an English audience for the first time
at the King's Hall, Covent Garden, next Sunday.</p>

<p>"On the same occasion the Literary Theatre
Club will give a performance of Mr Wilde's
'Salomé,' which, as you know, cannot be given
publicly in this country, owing to the Biblical
derivation of the subject. But 'Salomé' has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
been popular for years in Germany, and it has
also been played in Sweden, Russia, Italy, and
Holland."</p>

<p>It seems that "The Florentine Tragedy" has
also been played with great success in Germany.
It was translated by Dr Max Meyerfeld, and
was produced first at Leipsic, and afterwards at
Hamburg and Berlin. According to Mr Ross,
"The Florentine Tragedy" promises to become
almost as popular with German playgoers as
"Salomé" is now.</p>

<p>"The Florentine Tragedy," as already indicated,
is a brief one-act drama. There are only three
characters: an old Florentine merchant, his beautiful
wife, and her lover. The simple plot may be
briefly indicated. The merchant, arriving suddenly
at his home after a short absence, finds his
wife and his rival in her affections together at
supper. He makes a pretence at first of being
profoundly courteous, and the ensuing conversation
(as need hardly be said) is pointed, epigrammatic,
and witty. Then the old man gradually
leads up to what, it becomes obvious, had been
his fixed purpose from the beginning. He draws
the lover into a duel. This takes place in the
presence of the wife, who, indeed, holds aloft
a torch in order that the two swordsmen may
fight the more easily. The contest waxes fiercer,
and the swords are exchanged for daggers. The
wife casts the torch to the ground as the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
men close with each other, and the younger one
falls mortally wounded. The ending is dramatic.
The infuriated husband turns to his shrinking
wife and exclaims, "Now for the other!" The
woman, in mingled remorse and fear, says, "Why
did you not tell me you were so strong?" And
the husband rejoins, "Why did you not tell me
you were so beautiful?" As the curtain descends,
the couple, thus strangely reconciled,
fall into each other's arms.</p>

<p>The character of outstanding importance, of
course, is that of the old merchant. According
to those who have studied the play, he is a
strikingly effective figure, most cleverly and
delightfully drawn. In the opinion of Mr Moore
the part is one that would have fitted Sir Henry
Irving excellently well. The action of the drama
occupies less than half-an-hour.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to recall the
testimony of an Irish publisher quoted by Mr
Sherard in his "Life of Oscar Wilde." This
gentleman attended the sale of the author's
effects in Tite Street, and in a room upstairs
found the floor thickly strewn with letters addressed
to the quondam owner of the house and
a great quantity of his manuscripts. He concluded
that as the various pieces of furniture had
been carried downstairs to be sold their contents
had been emptied out on to the floor of this
room. Presently a broker's man came up to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and inquired what he was doing in the room,
and on his replying that finding the door open
he had walked in, the man said, "then somebody
has broken open the lock, because I locked the
door myself." This gentleman surmises that it
was from this room that various manuscripts that
have never been recovered were stolen!</p>

<p>When the piece was produced by the Literary
Theatre Club it suffered from inadequate acting.
Mr George Ingleton was quite overweighted
by the part of Simone, the Florentine merchant.
It is a part that requires an Irving to carry it
through, or, at anyrate, an actor of great experience,
and for anyone else to attempt it is a
piece of daring which can only result in failure.</p>

<p>It is curious that the denouement, which was
so severely handled by the critics when the play
was produced in Berlin, was the part of the piece
that seemed most to impress an English audience.
The epigram and the praises of strength and
beauty provoked no protest or dissatisfaction, as
those who had seen the German production expected
they would, nor was the audience in the
least shocked when the wife holds the torch for
her husband and lover to fight, nor when, at the
close of the encounter, she purposely throws it
down. This, of course, is the unlooked-for
climax of the piece, and the dramatic character
of the situation completely saved it.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WOMAN_COVERED_WITH_JEWELS" id="THE_WOMAN_COVERED_WITH_JEWELS"></a>"THE WOMAN COVERED WITH JEWELS"</h2>


<p>Finally we have arrived at what must always
be the most tantalising of all Wilde's plays because
the MS. has been lost and very little is
known about it. It had for title "The Woman
Covered With Jewels." The only copy of it
known to exist, a small quarto book of ruled
paper in the author's own handwriting, was
presumably stolen with the copies of "The
Incomparable and Ingenious History of Mr
W. H. Being the true Secret of Shakespeare's
Sonnets, now for the first time here fully set
forth," and "The Florentine Tragedy," at the
time of the Tite Street sale. But little is
known about the play&mdash;a very few privileged
persons having been favoured with a perusal
of it, and the only information the public have
been able to gather about it is from an article
by a well-known book-lover that appeared in a
weekly paper. I myself have not been able to
discover any further information.</p>

<p>The play was in prose and, like "Salomé,"
was a tragedy in one act. It was written about
1896.</p>

<p>According to the writer of the article referred
to, it was "presented by its author to a charming
and cultured Mayfair lady, well known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
London Society." He goes on to say that she
allowed a few well-known <i>littérateurs</i> to peruse
it, but that the manuscript is now lost and that
he has not succeeded in tracing a second copy
anywhere. There seems to be some confusion
here, for if this were the only copy it could not
have been stolen from the Tite Street sale, as,
according to the biography, was the case. One
thing, at anyrate, appears certain, and that is
that there is no copy in existence, or rather&mdash;for
if it was stolen it must be in someone's possession&mdash;available
at the present moment. It would
be interesting to know how the lady to whom
the book was presented came to lose it. Perhaps
she herself destroyed it at the period when so
many of his friends were so anxious to conceal
all traces of their friendship with its author.
Again, the MS. may only have been lent her,
and may have been returned by her to Wilde
before the crash. At anyrate, it seems incredible
that he should have parted with the
manuscript without keeping even a rough copy.
The point needs elucidation.</p>

<p>According to the writer of the article&mdash;"There
is little doubt that the lost tragedy by
Wilde was intended originally&mdash;like 'Salomé'&mdash;for
Sarah Bernhardt. It contains a part somewhat
like her <i>Izéil</i>. The period of the play is
that of the second century after Christ, a century
of heresy and manifold gospels that had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the Church of the day a thing divided by sects
and scarred with schisms. Fairly vigorous
Christian churches existed at Athens and
Corinth. From one of these there seceded a
most holy man. He withdrew into the desert,
and at the time the play begins was dwelling in
a cave 'whose mouth opened upon the tawny
sand of the desert like that of a huge lion.' His
reputation for holiness had gone forth to many
cities. One day there came to his cave a beautiful
courtesan, covered with jewels. She had
broken her journey in order to see and hear the
wonderful priest who had striven against the
devil in the desert. He sees the strange, beautiful
intruder, and, speaking of the faith that was
within him, tries to win one more convert to its
kingdom, glory, and power. She listens as Thais
listened to Paphnutius. The hermit's eloquence
sways her reason, while her exquisite beauty of
face and form troubles his constancy. She
speaks in turn and presses him to leave his
hermit home and come with her to the city.
There he may preach to better effect the
gospel of the Kingdom of God. 'The city
is more wicked than the desert,' she says, in
effect.</p>

<p>"While they are talking two men drew near
and gazed upon the unusual scene. 'Surely it
must be a king's daughter,' said one. 'She has
beautiful hair like a king's daughter, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
behold, she is covered with jewels.'</p>

<p>"At last she mounts her litter and departs,
and the men follow her. The priest has been
troubled, tortured by her beauty. He recalls
the melting glory of her eyes, the softly curving
cheeks, the red humid mouth. Recalls, too, the
wooing voice that was like rippling wind-swept
water. Her hair fell like a golden garment; she
was, indeed, covered with jewels.</p>

<p>"Evening draws near and there comes to the
mouth of the cave a man who says that robbers
have attacked and murdered a great lady who
was travelling near that day. They show the
horror-struck priest a great coil of golden
hair besmeared with blood. Here the tragedy
ends.</p>

<p>"One sees that 'The Woman Covered With
Jewels' is an outcome, and one more expression,
of that literary movement that gave us
'Salambo,' 'Thais,' 'Aphrodite,' 'Imperial
Purple,' and many more remarkable works of
a school, or group of writers, who, wearied of
the <i>jejune</i>, the effete, and much else, have
sought solace for their literary conscience in a
penman's reconquest of antiquity. Probably the
old-world story of Paphnutius and Thais inspired
the tragedy and Maeterlinck's plays suggested
its technique. Who can know? Assuredly its
tragic picture of devotion, passion, cupidity, and
murder would thrill and enthrall those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
could know it better than in this imperfect
portrayal. 'The Woman Covered With
Jewels' is worthy of the pen that wrote
'Salomé,' and 'The Sphinx.'</p>

<p>"Yet it is lost!"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FAIRY_STORIES" id="THE_FAIRY_STORIES"></a>THE FAIRY STORIES</h2>


<p>A little girl who had kept her fifth birthday
joyously in the garden of her father's home went
on the morrow to the great and grimy city which
was nearest to it. We were to visit the bazaars
and buy books and toys. As we went through
the great square in which the Town Hall stands
the small hand in mine told me that here was
something which we must stay to consider. We
stood at the base of the statue which the citizens
had raised in memory of a statesman's endeavour
and success. She looked steadily and long at
the figure of which the noble head redeemed
the vulgar insignificance of costume and posture.
"What did this man do, uncle?" she asked,
"that he has been turned into stone?" I was
dreadfully startled, for the horrid suspicion darted
through my mind that my little niece had remembered
my talk with her father about modern
sculpture, and at five years old had already begun
to pose. "Of course, it had to be stone not salt
in England," she went on to say, and I was reassured;
she at least was remembering Lot's
wife.</p>

<p>It was in the later spring of 1888, and when
the evening post brought me fresh from the
press "The Happy Prince and Other Tales,"
the first story told me that Oscar Wilde, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
whom men, even then, had many things sinister
and strange to say, had yet within him the heart
of a little child.</p>

<p>"High above the city, on a tall column, stood
the statue of the Happy Prince."</p>

<p>"When I was alive and had a human heart I
did not know what tears were, for I lived in the
Palace of Sans Souci, where sorrow is not allowed
to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions
in the garden, and in the evening I led
the dance in the great Hall. Round the garden
ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask
what lay beyond it, everything about me was
so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy
Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be
happiness, so I lived and so I died. And now
that I am dead they have set me up here so high
that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery
of my city, and though my heart is made of lead
yet I cannot choose but weep."</p>

<p>Here, strange to say, is the note of pathos
which we hear again and again in the volume
of fairy stories which many men look upon as
Oscar Wilde's best and most characteristic prose
work. Time after time they make me murmur
Vergil's untranslatable line <i>sunt lachrymæ rerum
et mentem mortalia tangunt</i>.</p>

<p>The felicity of expression is exquisite, and an
opulent imagination lavishes its treasures in every
story. Our author has come into full possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of his sovereignty of words and every sentence
has its carefully considered, yet spontaneous
charm. Nevertheless, Oscar Wilde makes the
Linnet his mouthpiece in the fourth story "The
Devoted Friend." "'The fact is, that I told him
a story with a moral.' 'Ah, that is always a very
dangerous thing to do,' said the Duck&mdash;and I
quite agreed with her."</p>

<p>Dangerous though it is, Oscar Wilde essayed
the endeavour. I do not think that children
would easily detect that <i>amari aliquid</i> which
makes the fairy stories fascinating to minds that
are mature, and I am sure that many little ones
have revelled in the Swallow's stories of what
he had seen in strange lands when he told "the
Happy Prince of the red ibises, who stand in
long rows on the banks of the Nile and catch
gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as
old as the world itself, and lives in the desert,
and knows everything; of the merchants who
walk slowly by the side of their camels, and
carry amber beads in their hands; of the King
of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black
as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the
great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and
has twenty priests to feed it with honey cakes;
and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on
large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies."</p>

<p>I suppose it would shock the authorities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Education Department at Whitehall if it were
suggested that the children in the Elementary
Day Schools should have for their reading lesson,
sometimes, the volume of "The Happy Prince
and Other Tales, by Oscar Wilde, illustrated by
Walter Crane and Jacomb Hood"&mdash;but I think
the starved and stunted imaginations of the children
in the great, cruel cities would revive and
grow if this could be done.</p>

<p>But perhaps it would have to be an expurgated
edition. The sad consciousness of, and stern
satire on, our social system might remain, the
children would take no hurt, and the weary
school teachers would be glad to hear and to
read a children's fairy tale, which sets the
student thinking and makes the more worldly
man consider his ways. But if I had the editing
of the book I would leave out here and there a
sentence.</p>

<p>"'Bring me the two most precious things in
the city,' said God to one of His angels; and the
angel brought him the leaden heart and the dead
bird.</p>

<p>"'You have rightly chosen,' said God, 'for in
my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing
for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy
Prince shall praise me.'" The children would not
like this, for in their ears sound often the severe
words of Sinai, "The Lord will not hold him
guiltless that taketh His name in vain," and I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
who delight in the beautiful prose poems, feel
that here the dead artist was not at his
best.</p>

<p>Some have said that there are no fairy stories
like Oscar Wilde's, but Hans Andersen had
written before him, and Charles Kingsley's
"Water Babies" was published long before
"The Happy Prince." The Dane managed to
touch on things Divine without a discord, and
Charles Kingsley's satire was not less keen than
Oscar's, but he could point his moral without
intruding very sacred things into his playful
pages, and I wish that the two last sentences of
"The Happy Prince" could be erased.</p>

<p>It is the gorgeous colour and the vivid sonorous
words that charm us most. It is easy to analyse
these sentences and to note how pearls and
pomegranates, and the hyacinth blossom, and
the pale ivory, and the crimson of the ruby,
again and again glow on the pages like the
illuminations of the mediæval missal; but each
story has its own peculiar charm.</p>

<p>"The Nightingale and the Rose" is a tale full
of passion and tenderness, and sad in the sorrow
of wasted sympathy and unrequited love.</p>

<p>"Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more
precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine
opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it,
nor is it set forth in the market-place. It may
not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
weighed out in the balance of gold."</p>

<p>I can fancy Oscar Wilde writing thus in the
happy days of his early married life in Chelsea,
in the little study where his best work was done,
whilst memories of the Chapel of Magdalen
murmured in his brain, and he heard again the
surpliced scholar reading from the lectern the
praise of wisdom which he transmuted into the
praise of love which was not wise. "It cannot
be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
for the price thereof. It cannot be valued with
the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the
sapphire. The gold and the crystal cannot equal
it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels
or fine gold. No mention shall be made of coral
or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above
rubies. The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
neither shall it be valued with pure gold."</p>

<p>Throughout "The Song of the Nightingale"
there is a reminiscence of that Song of Solomon
which Wilde told a fellow-prisoner he had
always loved.</p>

<p>"Many waters cannot quench love, neither
can the floods drown it: if a man would give all
the substance of his house for love, it would be
utterly contemned."</p>

<p>In "The Selfish Giant" another note is sounded.
As we read it we pass into the mediæval age, and
we think of the story of Christopher.</p>

<p>The giant keeps the garden to himself and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
children that played in it are banished, and
thenceforward its glories are gone. In the garden
of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The
birds did not care to sing in it as there were no
children, and the trees forgot to blossom. The
Snow covered up the grass with his great white
cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver,
but anon there came a child who wept as he
wandered in the desolated garden, and the Selfish
Giant's heart melted; once again the children's
voices are heard and the garden flourishes as it
did before, and the Giant grows old and watches
from his chair the children at their play. "I
have many beautiful flowers," he said, "but the
children are the most beautiful flowers of it all,"
till at last the grey old Giant finds again in his
garden the child who had first touched his hard
heart&mdash;"but when he came quite close his face
grew red with anger, and he said, 'Who hath
dared to wound thee?' for on the palms of the
child's hands were the prints of two nails, and
the prints of two nails were on the little feet.
'Who hath dared to wound thee?' cried the
Giant, 'tell me, that I may take my big sword
and slay him.' 'Nay,' answered the child, 'but
these are the wounds of love.'"</p>

<p>"The Devoted Friend" is altogether in another
vein. As the first story is fragrant of the East
and the second mediæval in its memories, so the
third is Teutonic, and "Hans and the Miller's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Friendship" reminds us of the Brothers Grimm.
Now that every child has the chance of reading
the German fairy stories, Oscar Wilde's tale will
be compared with theirs, but I think the children
will like this one best for the simple reason that,
being written in exquisite English, nothing that
has passed through the perils of translation can
have its charm. Children are wonderful, because
perfectly unconscious, critics of style.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if readers will enjoy "The Remarkable
Rocket" as they will the other stories.
The modern <i>milieu</i> intrudes here and there.
The satire is keen and there are some clever
epigrams. The Russian Princess "had driven
all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn
by six reindeer which was shaped like a great
golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay
the little princess herself"&mdash;and we think that
we are going to enjoy again the atmosphere of
Watteau, and are a little disappointed when we
find our author saying, "He was something of
a politician, and had always taken a prominent
part in the local elections, or he knew the proper
Parliamentary expressions to use." And the
story, alas! will suggest over and over again painful
thoughts which I would keep at a distance
when I read these other lovely tales. Was not
this sentence of evil omen? "'However, I don't
care a bit,' said the Rocket. 'Genius like mine
is sure to be appreciated some day,' and he sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
down a little deeper into the mud." And the
last sentence of all is terribly sinister. "'I knew
I should create a sensation,' gasped the Rocket,
and he went out."</p>

<p>"The House of Pomegranates" was published
in 1891, and is dedicated to Constance Mary
Wilde. Here, in a volume which the author
frankly calls a volume of "Beautiful Tales,"
is a very stern indictment of the social system
which, in his essay "The Soul of Man," Oscar
Wilde had so powerfully denounced. We know
how profoundly that essay has influenced the
minds of men in every country in Europe.
Translated into every tongue it has taught
the oppressed to resent the callous cruelty
of capital, but I doubt if its author was
altogether as earnest as he seems. Here, in
the story of the young King, we have a lighter
touch. It is as though the writer hesitated between
two paths. In the year 1895 the wrong
path had been taken if we may trust the record
of a conversation which took place in that
year.</p>

<p>"To be a supreme artist," said he, "one must
first be a supreme individualist."</p>

<p>"You talk of Art," said I, "as though there
were nothing else in the world worth living
for."</p>

<p>"For me," said he sadly, "there is nothing else."</p>

<p>But when Oscar Wilde dedicated "The House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of Pomegranates" to his wife the love of Beauty
and the love of humankind still seemed to go
together.</p>

<p>The young King is possessed with a passion
for beauty. The son of the old King's daughter,
by a secret marriage, his childhood and early
youth have been obscure, and he comes into his
kingdom suddenly. We see him in the Palace
where are gathered rich stores of all rare and
beautiful things and his love for them is an
instinct. The author in some exquisite pages
tells us of the glories of the King's house. Here,
as in the other book of which I have written,
the mind of the reader is helped to realise how
beautiful luxury may be. I must quote the description
of the young King's sleeping-chamber&mdash;"The
walls were hung with rich tapestries
representing the Triumph of Beauty. A large
press, inlaid with agate and lapis lazuli, fitted
one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously
wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of
powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were
placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass
and a cup of dark veined onyx. Pale poppies
were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed,
as though they had fallen from the tired hands
of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up
the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of
ostrich plumes sprang like white foam, to the
pallid silver of the fretted ceiling. A laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror
above its head. On the table stood a flat bowl
of amethyst."</p>

<p>But on the eve of the coronation, the King
dreams a dream. He is borne to the weavers'
quarter and marks their weary toil, and the
weaver of his own coronation robe has terrible
things to tell him.</p>

<p>"In war," answered the weaver, "the strong
make slaves of the weak, and in peace the rich
make slaves of the poor. We must work to
live, and they give us such mean wages that we
die. We toil for them all day long, and they
heap up gold in their coffers, and our children
fade away before their time, and the faces of
those we love become hard and evil. We tread
out the grapes, and another drinks the wine.
We sow the corn, and our own board is empty.
We have chains though no eye beholds them;
and are slaves, though men call us free."</p>

<p>"Sic vos non nobis!" The artist in words is
still haunted by his master Vergil's verses, and
he had not listened to Ruskin all in vain. The
Pagan point of view is not that which prevailed
in those happy months when "The House of
Pomegranates" was written. Perhaps Ruskin's
socialism made no very deep impression, but
Christian Art had its message once for Oscar
Wilde.</p>

<p>The young King sees in his dreams the toil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the weaver, and the diver, and of those who dig
for the red rubies, and when he wakes he puts
his pomp aside. In vain do his courtiers chide
him, in vain do those whom he pities tell him
that his way of redress is wrong and that "out
of the luxury of the rich cometh the life of the
poor."</p>

<p>The King asks, "Are not the rich and the poor
brothers?"</p>

<p>"Ay," answered the man in the crowd, "and
the name of the rich brother is Cain." So the
young King comes to the Cathedral for his
coronation clad in his leathern tunic and the
rough sheepskin cloak of other days, and when
the wise and worldly Bishop has told him in
decorous words even the same as his own
courtiers said.</p>

<p>"Sayest thou that in this House?" said the
young King, and he strode past the Bishop, and
climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood
before the Image of the Christ.</p>

<p>But I must not be tempted to continue the
quotation of this lovely story, and will only give
its closing words&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the young King came down from the
high altar, and passed home through the midst
of the people. But no man dared look upon his
face, for it was like the face of an angel."</p>

<p>Here once more is the music of the lectern
which an Oxford man of years ago cannot forget,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and I wonder if this story of the young King
was not written some time before those others
which complete the book.</p>

<p>"The Birthday of the Infanta" does not give
me the same delight. It is, of course, clever, as
all was that Oscar Wilde ever touched, but it is
cruel whilst it accuses cruelty. And now and
then we have a sentence or a phrase which seems
to have escaped revision. The story of the little
dwarf who made sport for the princess and whose
heart was broken when he found that she was
pleased, not by his dances, but by his deformity,
is not like its predecessor in the volume, and the
picture of "the little dwarf lying on the ground
and beating the floor with his clenched hands" did
not need the awkward addition "in the most
fantastic and exaggerated manner." But every
poet, of course, <i>aliquando dormitat</i>, and I would
rather appreciate than criticise.</p>

<p>Two more stories complete this beautiful book
and I think I have not said yet how beautiful
the type and binding and engravings are of this
edition of 1891 in which I am reading. If ever
it is reprinted it should have still the same
sumptuous setting forth.</p>

<p>Wilde himself described the <i>format</i> of the book
in the following passage:&mdash;"Mr Shannon is the
drawer of the dreams, and Mr Ricketts is the
subtle and fantastic decorator. Indeed, it is to
Mr Ricketts that the entire decorative design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of the book is due, from the selection of the
type and the placing of the ornamentation, to
the completely beautiful cover that encloses
the whole.</p>

<p>"The artistic beauty of the cover resides in
the delicate tracing, arabesques, and massing of
many coral-red lines on a ground of white ivory,
the colour effect culminating in certain high gilt
notes, and being made still pleasurable by the
overlapping band of moss-green cloth that holds
the book together."</p>

<p>"The Fisherman and his Soul," recalls many
stories and is very weird in its conception. We
think of Undine and of Peter Schmeidel and his
shadow; and again there is a reminiscence of
"The Arabian Nights." Yet once more it is the
old burden of the song "Love is better than wisdom,
and more precious than riches, and fairer
than the feet of the daughters of men. The fires
cannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench
it." But in the story there is seen distinctly
the strong attraction which the Ritual of The
Catholic Church had for Oscar Wilde. Those
who have read that fine poem, "Rome Unvisited,"
which even the saintly recluse of the
Oratory at Edgbaston could praise, will understand
how in the story of the "Fisherman and
his Soul" it is written.</p>

<p>"The Priest went up to the chapel, that he
might show to the people the wounds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of
God. And when he had robed himself with his
robes, and entered in and bowed himself upon
the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with
strange flowers that never had been seen before,
and after that he had opened the tabernacle, and
incensed the monstrance that was in it, and
shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it
again behind the veils, he began to speak to the
people."</p>

<p>And now I come to "The Star-Child&mdash;inscribed
to Miss Margot Tennant."</p>

<p>"He was white and delicate like swan ivory,
and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.
His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower,
and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure
water, and his body like the narcissus of a field
where the mower comes not." But his heart
was hard and his soul was selfish, and his evil
ways wrought mischief all around; so bitter
sorrow fell upon him and his comeliness departed,
and in pain and grief he was purged from his
sin.</p>

<p>This last is indeed a beautiful story, and not
once is there sounded the mocking note of
cynical disdain of men. If one had taken up
this tale and known not whose pen had traced it,
he would not hesitate to place it in his children's
hands.</p>

<p>Is it not good to think that tenderness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
humility and patience are seen herein to be more
beautiful than all the precious things which are
loved so ardently by the artistic mind? I have
shown, I hope, that in both of these exquisite
volumes, it may be seen that Oscar Wilde had
visions sometimes of the celestial city where the
angels of the little children do always behold the
face of the Father. And if, as other chapters of
this volume may seem to show, the vision splendid
died away and faded all too soon, purgatorial
pain came to the author, as to the star-child in
his story, and he who could build for his soul a
lordly pleasure house, and was driven forth
from it, may enter it again when he has purged
his sin.</p>

<p>If a keynote were wanted to Oscar Wilde's
verse it might be found in a couple of stanzas by
the poet whose work perhaps had the greatest
share in moulding his ideas and fashioning his
style. Charles Baudelaire, with all his love of
the terrible and the morbid, was an incomparable
stylist, and in these lines has almost formulated
a creed of art.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We can picture to ourselves the young Oxford
student studying these lines over and over again
till they had become part and parcel of himself.</p>

<p>Wilde himself has left it on record that he
"cannot imagine anyone with the smallest pretensions
to culture preferring a dexterously turned
triolet to a fine imaginative ballad." In the
majority of his poems, the beauties of nature,
flowers, the song of birds and the music of running
water are introduced either incidentally or
as the <i>leit motif</i>. In fact, he was responsible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the dictum that what English poetry has to fear
is not the fascination of dainty metre or delicate
form, but the predominance of the intellectual
spirit over the spirit of beauty.</p>

<p>That the expression of the beautiful need not
necessarily be simple was one of his earliest
contentions. "Are simplicity and directness of
utterance," he asks, "absolute essentials for
poetry?" and proceeds to answer his own question.
"I think not. They may be admirable
for the drama, admirable for all those imitative
forms of literature that claim to mirror life in its
externals and its accidents, admirable for quiet
narrative, admirable in their place; but their
place is not everywhere. Poetry has many
modes of music; she does not blow through one
pipe alone. Directness of utterance is good, but
so is the subtle recasting of thought into a new
and delightful form. Simplicity is good, but
complexity, mystery, strangeness, symbolism,
obscurity even, these have their value. Indeed,
properly speaking, there is no such thing as
Style; there are merely styles, that is all."</p>

<p>There we have a clear, concise and catholic
statement of his literary creed, and none other
was to be expected from one to whom Baudelaire,
Poe, Keats, and Rossetti were so many
masters whose influence was to be carefully
cultivated and whose methods were worthy of
imitation and study. His views on the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of simplicity in verse should be read by all who
desire to understand his method and do justice
to his work.</p>

<p>"We are always apt to think," he wrote, "that
the voices which sang at the dawn of poetry
were simpler, fresher, and more natural than
ours, and that the world which the early poets
looked at, and through which they walked, had
a kind of poetical quality of its own, and could
pass, almost without changing, into song. The
snow lies thick now upon Olympus, and its
scarped sides are bleak and barren, but once,
we fancy, the white feet of the Muses brushed
the dew from the anemones in the morning, and
at evening came Apollo to sing to the shepherds
in the vale. But in this we are merely lending
to other ages what we desire, or think we desire,
for our own. Our historical sense is at fault.
Every century that produces poetry is, so far,
an artificial century, and the work that seems to
us the most natural and simple product of its
time is probably the result of the most deliberate
and self-conscious effort. For nature is always
behind the age. It takes a great artist to be
thoroughly modern."</p>

<p>"Ravenna," the poem with which Oscar Wilde
won the Newdigate Prize, we find to be far above
the average of such effusions, though possessing
most of the faults inherent in compositions of
this kind. Grace and even force of expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
are not wanting, with here and there a pure
strain of sentiment and thought, and a keen appreciation
of the beauties of nature. Ever and
anon we come across some sentence, some <i>tournure
de phrase</i> which might belong to his later
work, as for instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"The crocus bed (that seems a moon of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round-girdled with a purple marriage-ring)."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But for the most part the poem is rather reminiscent
of "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," and
is chiefly interesting by reason of the promise
it holds forth.</p>

<p>The poems published in 1881 are preceded by
some dedicatory verses addressed to his wife
which are characterised by great daintiness and
simplicity, instinct with tender affection and
chivalrous homage.</p>

<p>"Helas," which forms a sort of preface to the
collection, is chiefly interesting on account of
the prophetic pathos of the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Surely there was a time I might have trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ave Imperatrix" will come as a surprise to
those unacquainted with Wilde's works. Most
people would have thought the author of "Dorian
Gray" the last man in the world to write a stirring
patriotic poem which would not be out of
place in a collection of Mr Kipling's works. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
copy of <i>The World</i> containing this poem found
its way to an officer in Lord Robert's force
marching on Candahar, and evoked the enthusiasm
and admiration of the whole mess. As
a proof of the author's originality and care in the
choice of similes he purposely discards the modern
heraldic device of the British lion for the more
correct and ancient leopards, as:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"The yellow leopards, strained and lean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treacherous Russian knows so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gaping blackened jaws are seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap through the hail of screaming shell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a fine swing about the metre of this
verse, and the description of the leopards as
"strained and lean" is a piece of word painting,
a felicity of expression that it would be difficult
to improve on. The whole poem is tense with
patriotic fervour, nor is it wanting in exquisitely
pathetic touches, as for instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Pale women who have lost their lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will kiss the relics of the slain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some tarnished epaulette&mdash;some sword&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"In vain the laughing girl will yearn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet her love with love-lit eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down in some treacherous ravine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clutching the flag, the dead boy lies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That he should have written such a poem is
proof conclusive of the author's extraordinary
versatility, and though a comparatively early
production is worthy to rank with the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
war poems in the language.</p>

<p>Current events at that time attracted his pen
for we find a set of verses on the death of the
ill-fated Prince Imperial, a sonnet on the Bulgarian
Christians, and others of a more or less
patriotic character. Few of these productions,
however, invite a very serious criticism. They
were of the moment and for the moment, and
have lost the appeal of freshness and actuality.</p>

<p>In "The Garden of Eros" we get a good
insight into Wilde's passionate fondness for
flowers, to whom they were human things with
souls. Probably no other verses of the poet so
well define and express this master passion of
his life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"... Mark how the yellow iris wearily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"And I will tell thee why the jacynth wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such dread embroidery of dolorous moan."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or again</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Close to a shadowy nook where half afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their own loneliness some violets lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That will not look the gold sun in the face."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I remember a lady telling me once that she
was in a London shop one day when Wilde
came in and asked as a favour that a lily be
taken out of the window because it looked so
tired. This looking on flowers as real live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
sentient things was no mere pose with him.
He was thoroughly imbued with the conviction
that they were possessed of feeling, and throughout
his poetical work we shall find endless applications
of this idea.</p>

<p>Of particular interest in this poem are the
verses descriptive of the various poets, his contemporaries.
Swinburne he alludes to most
happily, as far as the neatness of phrase is concerned
nothing could be better in this regard
than</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sung the Galilean's requiem."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>William Morris, "our sweet and simple
Chaucer's child," appeals to him strangely.
Many a summer's day he informs us he has
"lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy
weaves." His appreciation of Morris's verse is
keen and enthusiastic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"The little laugh of water falling down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not so musical, the clammy gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has less of sweetness in it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What a delicate metaphor that is, what an
exquisite poet's fancy. Not Keats himself could
have surpassed the "clammy gold close hoarded
in the tiny waxen town"&mdash;it is worthy to rank
with some of the daintiest flights in the "Queen
Mab speech," that modern Mercutios murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
so abominably.</p>

<p>Like every verse writer of his time Oscar
Wilde had felt the wondrous influence of
Rossetti, and no finer tribute to the painter
could be written than the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"All the World for him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gorgeous coloured vestiture must wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sorrow take a purple diadem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in Anguish beautiful; such is the empery which Painters held."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a stately splendour about the flow of
"a gorgeous coloured vestiture," and one pauses
to admire the choice of the last word, and can
picture the poet's delight when, like an artist in
mosaic who has hit upon the stone to fill up the
remaining interstice, he lighted on the word. It
is essentially <i>le mot juste</i>, no other could have
filled its place. So also is there a peculiar
happiness in the use of "empery." There is a
volume of sound and meaning in the word that
could with difficulty be surpassed.</p>

<p>In fact, in his choice of words Wilde always
and for ever deserves the glowing words of
praise that Baudelaire addressed to Theodore
de Bonville&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Vous avez prélassé votre orgueil d'architecte<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dans des constructions dont l'audace correcte<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fait voir quelle sera votre maturité."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when we come to a line like&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Against the pallid shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we realise how thoroughly the praise would be
deserved, and linger lovingly on the lilting music
of the words and the curious Japanese setting of
the picture evolved. The poem ends on a note
like the drawing in of a deep breath of country
air after a prolonged sojourn in towns.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Why soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodman will be here; how we have lived this night of June."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "Requiescat" quite a different note is
reached. The poem was written after the
death of a beloved sister; the sentiment rings
true and the very simplicity of the language
conveys an atmosphere of real grief that would
have been entirely marred by the intrusion of
any decorative or highly-coloured phrase. The
choice of Saxon words alone could produce
the desired effect, and the author has realised
this and made use almost exclusively of that
material. Nor was he ill-advised to let himself
be influenced so far as the metre is concerned
by Hood's incomparable "Bridge of
Sighs," and it was not in the metre alone that
he availed himself of that priceless gem of English
verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6q">"All her bright golden hair<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></span>
<span class="i6">Tarnished with rust,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">She that was young and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Fallen to dust."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is obviously inspired by</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6q">"Take her up tenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Lift her with care;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Fashioned so slenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Young, and so fair!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, on the other hand, Hood himself might
well have envied the exquisite sentiment contained
in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6q">"Speak gently, she can hear<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The daisies grow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lines were written at Avignon, surely
the place of all others, with its memories and
its mediæval atmosphere, to inspire a poem, the
dignity and beauty of which are largely due to
the simplicity of its wording.</p>

<p>During this period of travel we are struck by
two things. Firstly, how deeply impressed the
young poet was by the mysteries of the Catholic
Faith and how his indignation flamed up at the
new Italian <i>régime</i>; secondly, how apparent the
influence of Rossetti is in the sonnets he then
wrote.</p>

<p>His sympathies were all with the occupant of
St Peter's chair.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"But when I knew that far away at Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In evil bonds a second Peter lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wept to see the land so very fair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Look southward where Rome's desecrated town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies mourning for her God-anointed King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look heavenward! Shall God allow this thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not but some flame-girt Raphael shall come down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smite the Spoiler with the sword of pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "San Miniato" the influence of Rome upon
the young man's mind finds expression in words
which might have been written by a son of the
Latin Church.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"O crowned by God with thorns and pain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother of Christ! O mystic wife!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart is weary of this life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over sad to sing again,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he writes, and ends with the invocation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"O crowned by God with love and flame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O crowned by Christ the Holy One!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O listen ere the scorching sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show to the world my sin and shame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor can it be wondered at that the devotion
to the Madonna which forms so essential a
feature of the Catholic Faith should impress his
young and ardent spirit as it does nearly every
artist to whom the poetic beauty of this side of
It naturally appeals.</p>

<p>The Pope's captivity moved him again and
again to express his indignation in verse, and
from his poem, "Easter Day" we can gather
how deeply he was impressed both by the stately
ceremonial at St Peter's and by the sight of the
despoiled Pontiff. At this time also he seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to have been more or less yearning after a more
spiritual mode of life than he has been leading,
at least so one gathers from poems like
"E Tenebris" in which he tells us that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"The wine of life is spilt upon the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart is as some famine-murdered land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence all good things have perished utterly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well I know my soul in Hell must be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I this night before God's throne should stand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That he had visions of a possible time when a
complete change should be worked in his spiritual
condition seems clear from the concluding lines
of "Rome Unvisited."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Before yon field of trembling gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is garnered into dusty sheaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ere the autumn's scarlet leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flutter as birds adown the wold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may have run the glorious race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught the torch while yet aflame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called upon the Holy name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Him who now doth hide His face."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Apart from the light these poems throw upon
his mental and spiritual attitude at that period,
they are extremely interesting as revealing the
literary influences governing him at the time. I
have already referred to the resemblance between
his sonnets and the more finished ones of Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, and this point cannot better
be illustrated than by placing the work of the
two men in juxtaposition.</p>

<p>If we take, for instance, Rossetti's "Lady of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Rocks."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Mother, is this the darkness of the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Shadow of Death? and is that outer sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infinite imminent Eternity?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And does the death-pang by man's seed sustained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Time's each instant cause thy face to bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its silent prayer upon the Son, while He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blesses the dead with His hand silently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To His long day which hours no more offend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother of grace, the pass is difficult,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen as these rocks, and the bewildered souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throng it like echoes, blindly shuddering through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy name, O Lord, each spirit's voice extols,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose peace abides in the dark avenue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the bitterness of things occult."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and compare it with "E Tenebris." We are at
once struck with the same mode of expression,
the same train of thought and the same deep
note of pain in the two poems.</p>

<p>And again take Wilde's "Madonna Mia"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"I stood by the unvintageable sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the wet waves drenched face and hair with spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long red fires of the dying day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned in the west; the wind piped drearily;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the land the clamorous gulls did flee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Alas!' I cried, 'my life is full of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who can garner fruit or golden grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From these waste fields which travail ceaselessly!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My nets gaped wide with many a break and flaw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nathless I threw them as my final cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the sea, and waited for the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo! a sudden glory! and I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the black waters of my tortured past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The argent splendour of white limbs ascend!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and compare it with Rossetti's "Venetian Pastoral"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and "Mary's Girlhood," and we can
almost imagine that the painter was holding up
pictures to inspire the young poet.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Red underlip drawn in for fear of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white throat, whiter than the silvered dove,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>might almost have been written by Rossetti
himself.</p>

<p>More characteristically original are the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the black waters of my tortured past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The argent splendour of white limbs ascend,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>from the "Vita Nuova," though one cannot fail
to perceive a faint Baudelairian note.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Where behind lattice window scarlet wrought and gilt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some brown-limbed girl did weave thee tapestry,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>at once reminds us of the Rossetti influence.</p>

<p>The poem itself shows considerable skill in
construction and deftness in the moulding of the
sentences, moreover, there is a freshness in the
treatment of the theme that a less original writer
would have found great difficulty in imparting.
Here again we see the Catholic note as when he
writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Never mightest thou see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of Her, before whose mouldering shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day at Rome the silent nations kneel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who got from Love no joyous gladdening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only Love's intolerable pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only a sword to pierce her heart in twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the bitterness of child-bearing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is one especially fine bit of imagery&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"The lotus-leaves which heal the wounds of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie in thy hand&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which bears the very truest imprint of poetry.</p>

<p>With the poet's return to England, a reaction
took place, and the sight of English woodlands
and English lanes caused a strong revulsion of
feeling.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"This English Thames is holier far than Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those harebells like a sudden flush of sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaking across the woodland, with the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meadow-sweet and white anemone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fleck their blue waves,&mdash;God is likelier there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The green fields and the smell of the good
brown earth come as a refreshing contrast to the
incense laden atmosphere of foreign cathedrals.
And yet his fancy delights in commingling the
two. In the "violet-gleaming" butterflies he
finds Roman Monsignore (he anglicises the word
by the way and gives it a plural "s,"), a lazy pike
is "some mitred old Bishop <i>in partibis</i>," and
"The wind, the restless prisoner of the trees,
does well for Palestrina."</p>

<p>He revels in the contrast that the refreshing
simplicity of rural England presents to the pomp
and splendour of Rome. The "lingering orange
afterglow" is "more fair than all Rome's lordliest
pageants." The "blue-green beanfields"
"tremulous with the last shower" bring sweeter
perfume at eventide than "the odorous flame-jewelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
censers the young deacons swing."
Bird life suggests the conceit that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the Mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were out of tune now for a small brown bird<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Sings overhead."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His love of nature, his passion for flowers and
the music of nature find continued and ecstatic
expression.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Everything appeals to him, "the heavy lowing
cattle stretching their huge and dripping mouths
across the farmyard gate," the mower whetting
his scythe, the milkmaid carolling blithely as she
trips along.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Sweet are the hips upon the Kentish leas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That round and round the linden blossoms play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the heifer breathing on the stall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick wall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No matter that he mixes up the seasons somewhat
and that having sung of bursting figs he
refers, in the next line, to the cuckoo mocking
the spring&mdash;"when the last violet loiters by the
well"&mdash;the poem is still a pastoral breathing
its fresh flower-filled atmosphere of the English
countryside. Wilde is, however, saturated with
classical lore and (though on some minds the
fantasy may jar) he introduces Daphnus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Linus, Syrinx and Cytheræa. But he is faithful
to his English land, he talks of roses which "all
day long in vales Æolian a lad might seek for"
and which "overgrows our hedges like a wanton

touch. "Many an unsung elegy," he
tells us, "Sleeps in the reeds that fringe our
winding Thames." He peoples the whole
countryside with faun and nymph&mdash;</p>

<p>Wilde never wrote anything better in verse
than this with the single exception of "The Ballad
of Reading Gaol." The poem deserves to rank
among the finest pastorals in the language. It
is essentially musical, written with artistic restraint
and with a discrimination of the use of
words and their combination that marks the
great artist. It is a true nature poem and it
will appeal to all those who prefer musical verse
to the artificial manufacture of rhymes, and
simple sentences to the torturing of words into
unheard-of combinations.</p>

<p>As a contrast to it comes the "Magdalen
Walks" which, in construction and rhythm, is
somewhat lacking in ease and freedom. It is a
curious thing that Wilde's affections seemed to
alternate between the unordered simplicity of
English woods and meadows and the trim artificial
parterres and bouquets of Versailles or Sans
Souci. There is a constraint about the metre of
this poem which does rather suggest a man walking
along a trim avenue from which he can perceive
flowers, meadows and riotous hedges&mdash;in
the distance. There is also a suggestion of
Tennyson's "Maud" about&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"And the plane to the pine tree is whispering some tale of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it rustles with laughter and tosses its mantle of green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gloom of the wych elm's hollow is lit with the iris sheen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the burnished rainbow throat and the silver breast of a dove."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Impression du Matin" might be said to be a
successful attempt to render a Whistler pastel
into verse, but there is a human note about the
last verse that elevates the poem far above such
a mere <i>tour de force</i>, and there is a fine sense of
effect in the picture of the "pale woman all
alone" standing in the glimmering light of the
gas lamp as the rays of the sun just touch her
hair.</p>

<p>"A Serenade" and "Endymion" possess all
the qualities that a musical setting demands,
but do not call for especial comment. It is,
however, in "La Bella Donna della mia Mante"
that the expression of the poet's genius finds
vent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"As a pomegranate, cut in twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White-seeded, is her crimson mouth"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is as perfect a metaphor as one could well wish
to find.</p>

<p>"Charmides" is a more ambitious effort than
anything he had yet attempted. The word-painting
is obviously inspired by Keats, for
whose work he had an intense admiration.
Such lines as "Came a great owl with yellow
sulphurous eyes," and "Vermilion-finned with
eyes of bossy gold" might have been taken
straight out of "Lamia," so truly has he caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the spirit of his master. But if enamoured of
Keats's gorgeous colouring Wilde revelled in the
construction of jewelled phrase and crimson line,
there is another source of inspiration noticeable
in the poem. Had Shakespeare never written
"Venus and Adonis," Wilde might have written
"Charmides" but it would not have been the
same poem. The difference between the true
poet who has studied the great verse of bygone
ages and the mere imitator is that one will produce
a work of art enhanced by the suggestions
derived from the contemplation of the highest
conception of genius, whereas the other will outrun
the constable and merely accentuate and
burlesque the distinguishing characteristics of
the work of others. In the case in point, whilst
we note with pleasure and interest the points of
resemblance between the poem and the models
that its author has followed, we are conscious
that what we are reading is a work of art in
itself and that its intrinsic merits are enhanced
by the points of resemblance and do not depend
on them for their existence.</p>

<p>There is another poem&mdash;"Ballade de Marguerite"&mdash;which
recalls memories of Keats,
closely resembling as it does "La Belle Dame
Sans Merci." Rarely has the old ballad form
been more successfully treated. We catch the
very spirit of mediævalism in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Perchance she is kneeling in St. Denys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(On her soul may our Lady have grammercy!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, if she is praying in lone chapelle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might swing the censer and ring the bell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is so easy to overdo the thing, to produce
a bad counterfeit made up of Wardour Street
English, that to retain the simplicity of language
and the slight <i>soupçon</i> of Chaucerian English
requires all the skill of a master craftsman, and
the intimate knowledge of the value and date of
words that can only result from a close acquaintance
with the works of the ballad writers.</p>

<p>In "The Dole of the King's Daughter" Wilde
again essays the ballad form, but this time the
treatment shows more traces of the Rossetti influence.
The ballad spirit is maintained with
unerring skill and the form perfectly adhered to
throughout. To quote good old Izaak Walton&mdash;"old-fashioned
poetry but choicely good."</p>

<p>As conveying the idea of impending tragedy
nothing could be more effective than the simplicity
of the lines</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"There are two that ride from the south and east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two from the north and west,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the king's daughter rest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this ballad as in the "Chanson" he uses the
old device, so common in ancient ballads, of
making the alternate lines parenthetical, as, for
instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Among the sonnets written at this period the
one on Keats's grave in which he does homage to
him whom he reverenced as a master is especially
felicitous in its ending&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5q">"Thy name was writ in water&mdash;it shall stand<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And tears like mine will keep thy memory green<br /></span>
<span class="i5">As Isabella did her Basil-tree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Than the graceful introducing of Keats's poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
no more delicate epitaph could be well imagined.
Shelley's last resting-place likewise inspired his
pen and there is an "Impression de Voyage"
written at Katakolo at the period of his visit to
Greece in company with Professor Mahaffy, the
concluding line of which, "I stood upon the soil
of Greece at last," conveys more by its reticence
than could be expressed in volumes.</p>

<p>Of his five theatrical sonnets headed "Impressions
de Theatre," one is addressed to the late Sir
Henry Irving and the three others to Miss Ellen
Terry. It is curious that of the three Shakespearean
characters he mentioned as worthier of
the actor's great talents than Fabiendei Franchi&mdash;viz.
Lear, Romeo, and Richard III.,&mdash;the only
one that Irving ever played was Romeo, and in
that part he was a decided failure, which, considering
his peculiar mannerisms and method, as
well as his age at the time, was not to be
wondered at. The fifth was probably intended
for Madame Sarah Bernhardt, whose wonderful
rendering of Phèdre could not fail to deeply
impress so cultured a critic as the author of these
poems.</p>

<p>In "Panthea" Oscar Wilde gives rein to his
amorous fancy, and, inspired by the poets of
Greece and Rome, peoples the world with gods
and goddesses who mourn the old glad pagan
days&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Back to their lotus-haunts they turn again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>How rich is the language here employed, how
exquisite the lilt of "soft purple-lidded sleep."
Not even Tennyson in "The Lotus Eaters" has
done anything better than this. And how
delicately expressed is the idea embodied in
the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>I quote the two parodies to show how little
Oscar Wilde's verse was appreciated by his contemporaries.
There is an unfairness and misrepresentation
about them which is significant
of how the poet's poses and extravagancies had
prejudiced the public mind.</p>

<p>In the two love poems "Apologia" and "Quia
multi Amori" a deeper key is struck, and a note
of pain predominates. There is a restraint about
the versification and the colour of the words
that strikes the right chord and tunes the lyre
to a subdued note.</p>

<p>The underlying passion and regret find their
supreme expression in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Ah! hadst thou liked me less and loved me more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all those summer days of joy and rain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or stood a lackey in the House of Pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "hadst thou liked me less and loved me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
more" deserves to pass into the language with
Richard Lovelace's</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Loved I not honour more."<br /></span>

<p>In "Humanitad" we get a view of the country
in winter time, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2q">"The gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hoots to see the moon; across the meads<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a stray seamew with its fretful cry<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The picture is complete, we see the bare
countryside, the sky grey with impending snow,
and the animal life introduced uttering nature's
cry of desolation. But hope is not dead in the
poet's breast; he sees where, when springtime
comes, "nodding cowslips" will bloom again and
the hedge on which the wild rose&mdash;"That sweet
repentance of the thorny briar"&mdash;will blossom
out. He runs through the whole flower calendar,
using the old English names "boy's-love," "sops
in wine," and "daffodillies."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour<br /></span>

<p>Once more we note how the flowers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
personalities for him, a view which could not
long escape the humorists of <i>Punch</i>, and which
was amply taken advantage of by the writer of
some burlesque verses, two of which are sufficiently
amusing to quote&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Nature appeals to Oscar Wilde in all her
moods, and though he might at times assume
the pose of preferring art to nature, he gives
expression to his real feelings when he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6q">"Ah! somehow life is bigger after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i6">Than any painted Angel could we see<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The God that is within us!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lines speak for themselves and are strongly
indicative of his attitude towards nature and art
at that period. The true spirit of Catholicism
had gripped him; the influence of Rome was
at work, though enfeebled, and remained latent
within him till in his hour of passing he found
peace in the bosom of the great Mother, who
throughout the ages has always held out her
arms to the sinner and the outcast.</p>

<p>There has always been a certain amount of
mystery attached to another poem of Wilde's
called "The Harlot's House," written at the
same period as "The Duchess of Padua" and
"The Sphinx"&mdash;that is, when he was living in
the Hotel Voltaire. It was originally published
in a magazine not later than June 1885. It is a
curious thing that all researches up to the present
as to the name of the publication have proved
fruitless, and that the approximate date of the
appearance of the verses has been arrived at
by reference to a parody entitled "The Public
House," which appeared in <i>The Sporting Times</i>,
of all papers in the world, on 13th June 1885.
First, an edition of the poem was brought out
privately by the Methuen Press in 1904 with
five illustrations by Althea Gyles, in which the
bizarre note is markedly, though artistically,
dominant. Another edition was privately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
printed in London in 1905 in paper wrappers.</p>

<p>The idea of this short lyrical poem is that the
poet stands outside a house and watches the
shadows of the puppet dancers "race across
the blind."</p>

<p>"The dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss"&mdash;the
"Treues Liebes Herz"&mdash;"like strange
mechanical grotesques" or "black leaves wheeling
in the wind." The marionettes whirl in the
ghostly dance, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i5">A phantom lover to her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sometimes they seemed to try and sing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The man turns to his companion and remarks
that "the dead are dancing with the dead," but
drawn by the music she enters the house. As
Love enters the house of Lust the gay seductive
music changes to a discord, and the horrible
shadows disappear. Then the dawn breaks,
creeping down the silent street "like a
frightened girl."</p>

<p>That is all, but as a high specimen of imagina-verse
it stands alone. That the author was inspired
by memories of Baudelaire and Poe is
beyond dispute. Nevertheless, the poem, in
conception as well as execution, is essentially
original. The puppet dancers' <i>motif</i> was afterwards
introduced by him with telling effect as
we shall see later in "The Ballad of Reading
Gaol." Hardly ever have the bizarre and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
<i>macabre</i> been used with such artistic effect as in
this short poem, nor have the imaginative gifts of
its author ever found a finer scope. If he had
written nothing else than these lines they would
confer immortality on him. Like all truly great
work they are imperishable and will form part of
English literature when far more widely read
effusions are set aside and forgotten.</p>

<p>I have remarked on the original character of
the poem in spite of its obvious sources of inspiration,
and there can be no better way of
verifying this than by giving an example of
Baudelaire's own incursion into puppet land&mdash;</p>

<p>The French poem lacks the simplicity and the
directness of its English fellow. It appears
overloaded and artificial in comparison, and
above all it lacks the music which results from
the juxtaposition of the Anglo-Saxon a, e, i, and
u sounds, and the Latin ahs and ohs.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, as an example of the
precious and artificial in literature, a further
poem of Wilde's written at this period, "The
Sphinx," reveals another phase of his extraordinarily
versatile genius.</p>

<p>The metre of the poem is the same as that of
"In Memoriam," though, owing to the stanzas
being arranged in two long lines instead of the
fairly short ones in Tennyson's poem, this might
at first escape attention. The poet at the time
of writing we learn had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"hardly seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some twenty summers cast their green for Autumn's gaudy liveries."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(which would seem to indicate that this part,
at any rate, was written at an earlier period than
the rest of the poem), and in the very first lines
he tells us that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"In a dim corner of my rooms far longer than my fancy thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beautiful and silent sphinx has watched me through the silent gloom."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Day and night&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"this curious cat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies crouching on the Chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we have in a very few words an exact
picture of this "exquisite grotesque half-woman
and half-animal," whom, after the manner of
Edgar Allan Poe with his raven, he proceeds to
apostrophise&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Oh tell me" [he begins] "were you standing by when Isis to Osiris knelt?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union for Antony?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and plies her with many questions of similar
nature. Presently he adjures her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Lift up your large black satin eyes which are like cushions where one sinks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fawn at my feet, Sphinx! and sing me all your memories."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This idea of comparing the velvet depths of
the eyes to "cushions where one sinks" is quaint
and original, though distinctly decadent, nor is
the note of the <i>macabre</i> wanting, as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"When through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet Ibis flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning mandragores."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a wonderful use of contrast in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
introduction of sweating mandragores in connection
with the purple of the corridors and the
scarlet plumage of the Ibis. How daring, likewise,
the grotesque note introduced as he recites
the catalogue of her possible lovers and asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Did giant Lizards come and couch before you on the reedy banks?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on you in your trampled couch?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling towards you in the mist?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with passion as you passed them by?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The speaker will find out the secret of her
amours. There is nothing too bizarre, too
monstrous to include in the list.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Had you shameful secret quests" [he asks] "and did you hurry to your home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some nereid coiled in amber foam with curious rock crystal breasted?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not Baudelaire himself could have invented
anything more precious than the description of
this sea-nymph, but the gruesome must be
introduced. "Did you," he inquires,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Steal to the border of the bar and swim across the silent lake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid your lupanar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the painted swathèd dead?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Wilde catalogues through the whole Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
mythology; he is inclined to give first place to
"Ammon."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame: you made the hornèd god your own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You stood behind him on his throne: you called him by his secret name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You whispered monstrous oracles into the caverns of his ears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blood of goats and blood of steers you taught him monstrous miracles."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Decadent the idea may be, but how cleverly,
how subtly the effects are produced and how
well sustained is the atmosphere of chimerical,
nightmare horrors. Wilde makes use of the
impression derived from the contemplation
of colossal figures&mdash;the Egyptian galleries
of the Louvre were, one may be certain, a
daily haunt of his at the time&mdash;and he describes&mdash;"Nine
cubits span" and his limbs are
"Widespread as a tent at noon," but he was
of flesh and blood for all that.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His thick soft throat was white as milk and threaded with thin veils of blue,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he was royally clad, for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Curious pearls like frozen dew were embroidered on his flaming silk."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His love of rare and beautiful things finds an
outlet in the description of the jewels and retinue
of the god.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Before his gilded galliot ran naked vine-wreathed corybantes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to draw his chariot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Barbaric splendour and Eastern gorgeousness
we have here and in one line the sense of immense
wealth is conveyed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The meanest cup that touched his lips was fashioned from a chrysolite."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But now&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"The god is scattered here and there: deep hidden in the windy sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw his giant granite hand still clenchèd in impotent despair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And he bids her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Go seek the fragments on the moor and wash them in the evening dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated paramour."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With mocking irony he tells her to "wake
mad passions in the senseless stone."</p>

<p>He counsels her to return to Egypt, her lovers
are not dead&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"They will rise up and hear your voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to kiss your mouth!..."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He advises to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Follow some raving lion's spoor across the copper-coloured plain,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and take him as a lover or to mate with a tiger&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"And toy with him in amorous jests, and when he turns and snarls and gnaws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise him with your agate breasts!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But "her sullen ways" pall on him, her
presence fills him with horror, "poisonous and
heavy breath makes the light flicker in the
lamp."</p>

<p>The poet wonders what "songless tongueless
ghost of sin crept through the curtains of the
night." He drives the cat away with every
opprobrious epithet for she wakes in him "each
bestial sense" and makes him what he "would
not be." She makes his "creed a barren shame,"
and wakes "foul dreams of sensual life," and
with a return to sanity he chases her away.
"Go thou before," he cries,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"And leave me to my crucifix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pallid burden sick with pain watches the world with wearied eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps for every soul in pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On this note of pessimism and refusal the
poem ends. In the realm of the fantastic it has
no equal and though the objection may be raised
that the whole thing is unhealthy, the truth is
that it is merely an experimental excursion in
the abnormal. It has all the fantastic unreality
of Chinese dragons, and, therefore, can in no way
be harmful. The nightmare effect has no lasting
influence. We read it as we would any other
imaginative grotesque. But whilst we are alternately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
fascinated and repulsed by the subject,
we are lost in admiration of the decorative treatment
of the theme. The whole performance is
artificial, but so is all Oriental art.</p>

<p>It is true that Baudelaire's poems, with their
morbid, highly polished neurotic qualities, had fascinated
the young artist and exercised a powerful
influence over him, but "The Sphinx" was
an achievement apart and totally different from
any other of his poems. It is more in the nature
of an extravaganza, an opium dream described in
finely chiselled, richly tinted phrases. Every
young poet goes through various phases and this
was only a phase in the author's literary career.
Nothing could be better than the workmanship,
and that the poem should so rivet the attention
and attract where it most repels is the greatest
tribute to the genius of its creator. It is essentially
a weird conception expressed in haunting
cadences, an esoteric gem for all those who
have brains to think and the necessary artistic
sense to appreciate really good work. That
persons of inferior mental calibre and narrow
views should be shocked by it is only to be
expected, and the author himself excused the
delay in publishing it by explaining that "it
would destroy domesticity in England!" The
original edition, it may be mentioned, was published
in September 1894 by Messrs Elkin
Mathews and John Lane, and was limited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
two hundred copies issued at 42s. with twenty-five
on larger paper at 105s. It was magnificently
illustrated by Mr C. R. Ricketts, the
delicacy and distinction of whose work is too
well known to need comment.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to the artificiality and
decadent character of "The Sphinx" stands the
author's imperishable "Ballad of Reading Gaol."
What the circumstances were that led to the
writing of this great masterpiece have been
already sufficiently dealt with in the earlier
portion of this work. It has been aptly said
that all great art has an underlying note of pain
and sorrow, beautiful work may be produced
without it, but not the work that is worthy to
rank among the great creative masterpieces of
the world. "Quand un homme et une poésie,"
writes Barbey d'Aubrevilly, "ont dévalé si bas
dans la conscience de l'incurable malheur qui est
fond de toutes les voluptés de l'existence poésie
et homme ne peuvent plus que remonter."
There can be no doubt that this poem could
never have been written but for the terrible
ordeal the poet had been through. It is incomparably
Wilde's finest poetic work&mdash;great, not
only by reason of its beauty, but great on
account of the feeling for suffering humanity,
his power to enter into the sorrows of others and
to forget his own trials in the sympathetic contemplation
of the agony of his fellow-sufferers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
which it reveals. The words of another distinguished
French critic might almost have been
written about him:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Désormais divorcée d'avec l'enseignement
historique, philosophique et scientifique, la poésie
se trouve ramenée à so fonction naturelle et
directe, qui est de réaliser pour nous la vie, complémentaire
du rêve, du souvenir, de l'espérance,
du désir; de donner un corps à ce qu'il y a
d'insaisissable dans nos pensées et de secret dans
le mouvement de nos âmes; de nous consoler ou
de nous châtier par l'expression de l'ideal ou par
le spectacle de nos vices. Elle devient non pas
<i>individuelle</i>, suivant la prédiction un peu hasardeuse
de l'auteur de <i>Jocelyn</i>, mais <i>personnelle</i>, si
nous sous-entendons que l'ame du poëte est
nécessairement une âme collective, une corde
sensible et toujours tendue que font vibrer les
passions et les douleurs de ses semblables."</p></blockquote>

<p>With Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner," "Reading
Gaol," holds first place amongst the ballads
of the world, and by many critics it is held, by
reason of its deep feeling and anguished intensity,
to be a finer piece of work than the older poet's
<i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>.</p>

<p>Although the author's identity was concealed
under the cypher "C33," there was never a
moment's doubt as to who the writer was. It
came as a shock to the British public that the
man who, but a couple of years before, had stood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the public pillory, the man whose work the great
majority, who had never even read it, believed to
be artificial, meretricious, and superficial, should
be the author of a deeply moving poem that
could be read by the most prudish and strait-laced.</p>

<p><i>The Times</i>, that great organ of English respectability,
devoted a leading article to it of a highly
eulogistic character. The edition was sold out
at once, and the book was on all men's tongues.
Wherever one went one heard it discussed, priest
and philistine were as loud in their praises of it
as the most decadent of minor poets. No poem
had for a generation met with such a friendly
reception or caused such a sensation.</p>

<p>A critical notice of the poem from the pen of
Lady Currie appeared in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>
for July 1904. In it the author writes of the
"terrible 'Ballad of Reading Gaol' with its
splendours and inequalities, its mixture of poetic
farce, crude realism, and undeniable pathos."
As to the crudeness of the realism, that is a mere
matter of opinion: it is easy to supply an adjective&mdash;it
is more difficult to justify the use of it,
and give satisfactory reasons for its application.
Realistic the poem doubtless is&mdash;crude, never,
but the writer shows a far keener appreciation
when she says&mdash;"all is grim, concentrated tragedy
from cover to cover. A friend of mine," Lady
Currie says, "who looked upon himself as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
judge in such matters, told me that he would
have placed certain passages in this poem, by
reason of their terrible, tragic intensity, upon a
level with some of the descriptions in Dante's
'Inferno,' were it not that 'The Ballad of
Reading Gaol' was so much more infinitely
human."</p>

<p>Among the many laudatory notices that appeared
at the time, there is an extract from a
review of the work taken from a great London
paper and quoted by a French writer which is
worth reprinting as showing the attitude of the
press towards the poem.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The whole is awful as the pages of Sophocles.
That he has rendered with his fine art so much
of the essence of his life and the life of others in
that inferno to the sensitive is a memorable thing
for the social scientist, but a much more memorable
thing for literature. This is a simple, a
poignant, a great ballad, one of the greatest in
the English language."</p></blockquote>

<p>Never, perhaps, since Gray's "Elegy" had a
poem been so revised, pruned and polished over
and over again as this cry from a prison cell.
The publisher was driven to the verge of distraction
by the constant alterations and emendations,
the placing of a comma had become a matter of
moment to the fastidious author, but the work
was published in its entirety save for two or
three stanzas concerning one of the prison officials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
that it was deemed wise to suppress.</p>

<p>The poem bears the dedication&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">In Memoriam</span><br />
C. T. W.<br />
Sometime Trooper of the Royal Horse Guards<br />
Obiit, H.M. Prison, Reading, Berkshire<br />
July 7th, 1896.<br />
</p>

<p>The case of the trooper to whose memory the
work is dedicated excited a good deal of interest
at the time. He had a fit of jealousy, murdered
his sweetheart, and though public opinion was
inclined to take a merciful view of the crime,
and a petition was presented to the Home
Secretary for the withdrawal of the capital sentence,
it was without effect, and the extreme
penalty of the law was carried out in the Gaol
at Reading.</p>

<p>The first line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"He did not wear his scarlet coat"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>rivets the attention at once, and as surely as do
the opening lines of "The Ancient Mariner."
The reason for this is given at once&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6q">"For wine and blood are red<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And blood and wine were on his hands<br /></span>
<span class="i6">When they found him with the dead."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That the whole incident that led to the man's
being there should be communicated in the
very first stanza, to make that stanza complete,
is an artistic necessity, and in the next two lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
we are told who the victim is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5q">"The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And murdered in her bed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tragedy is complete. We have the picture
of the soldier deprived of his uniform and the
whole story is revealed to us. A more concise
or supremely reticent description of the pathetic
drama there could not be. But the picture must
be filled in even to the most trivial detail, and
we see the poor wretch taking his daily exercise
among the prisoners awaiting their trial, attired
in "a suit of shabby grey," trying to demean
himself like a man and, trivial, but, from the
artist's point of view, important detail, with a
cricket cap on his head. There is a world of
pathos and lines of unspoken tragedy in that
cricket cap worn by a man whose days are
numbered, who never will play a game again
and whose mind must be occupied with thoughts
far removed from sport and amusement save
perhaps when they may revert to happy days
spent with bat and ball, and which will never
recur again. But though his step be jaunty, the
oppression of his impending doom is on him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5q">"I never saw a man who looked<br /></span>
<span class="i6">So wistfully at the day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We can see that prison yard, the circle of
convicts pacing the melancholy round at ordered
intervals and with measured tread, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
strong man, full of life and vigour looking up
at God's blue sky and drinking in the air with
greedy lungs. We can see the author of the
poem, the erstwhile social favourite, in his convict
garb walking</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5q">"With other souls in pain<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Within another ring."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and his horror as he receives the information
muttered by some fellow-prisoner through closed
lips that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"That fellow's got to swing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In words, the simplicity and intensity of which
are sublime, he tells us of how the news affected
him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5q">"Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Suddenly seemed to reel."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That apostrophe to the Redeemer is a revelation
in itself coming from a man who is enduring

fade into insignificance and are forgotten in the
presence of a fellow-creature's crucifixion&mdash;</p>

<p>Already he is purified by his months of trial
and tribulation, and he can enter sympathetically
into the sorrows of others and share their burden.</p>

<p>He now understands the reason of the jaunty
step and the defiant manner, he himself has tried
to flee from his thoughts.</p>

<p>He realises the meaning of that "wistful

<p>It has been objected that making sword rhyme
with word is a makeshift, but surely it is patent
to anyone with any artistic sense whatever that
this forced rhyme avoids the danger of making
the verse too facile, and, far from being a piece
of slovenly writing, is the well-thought-out scheme
of a perfect master of his craft. It is one of those
stupid objections that superficial critics are so apt
to raise when utterly devoid themselves of any
sense of proportion or fitness.</p>

<p>The idea that all men, young or old, kill the
thing they love is not only original but it is a
very fine flight of metaphor&mdash;there is a whole
sermon in the conception, and Wilde elaborates
the theme&mdash;</p>

<p>It is as we read these lines that our thoughts are
immediately directed to "The Dream of Eugene
Aram," that incomparable masterpiece of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
poet, who likewise was looked upon as a mere
jester whose work should not be treated seriously,
but who has left us three of the finest and most
deeply moving poems in the English language.
There is a striking resemblance in the wording
between the two poems, but without disparaging
Hood's work there can be no possible doubt as
to which is the greater and more noble achievement.</p>

<p>Another stanza elaborates the theme still
further and the fact is recorded that though
every man kills the thing he loves, yet death is
not always meted out to him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5q">"He does not die a death of shame<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Within these grim prison walls all the horrible
details of execution obtrude themselves upon the
wretched captive. He has tasted the horrors of
solitary confinement, of being spied on night and
day by grim, taciturn warders who, at frequent
intervals, slide back the panel in the door to
observe through the grated opening that the
prisoner is all right. So he can feel all the
torture that a man under sentence of death
must go through at having to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Sit with silent men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i7">And when he tries to pray."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ceaseless watch that is kept on the poor
wretch lest he should be tempted, given the opportunity,
to "rob the prison of its prey" by
doing violence on himself, the whole grim ceremonial
of the carrying out of the law's decree
are conjured up by him. He pictures the doomed
man awakened from sleep by the entrance of the
Sheriff, and the Governor of the Gaol accompanied
by the "shivering Chaplain robed in white." He
dwells on the hurried toilet, the putting on of
the convict dress for the last time whilst the
doctor takes professional stock of every nervous
symptom. It is to be hoped that the lines descriptive
of the doctor are purely imaginative&mdash;one
must hope, for the credit of the medical
profession, that it has no foundation in personal
experience. Then there is the awful thirst that
tortures the victim and another introduction
of an apparently trivial detail, "the gardener's
gloves" worn by the hangman. But the detail
is not trivial, its introduction adds to the ghastliness
of the scene. The reading of the Burial
Service over a man yet living is another realistic
touch that serves its purpose. With him we can
enter into the agony of the condemned wretch
as he prays</p>

</div></div>

<p>Wilde proceeds with the strict narrative. He
tells us how for six weeks that Guardsman walked
the prison yard still wearing the same suit and
his head covered with the same incongruous
headgear.</p>

<p>Still does he cast yearning glances at the sky,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"And at every wandering cloud that trailed<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Its ravelled fleeces by."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the man is no coward, he does not wring his
hands and bemoan his fate, he merely kept his
eyes on the sun "and drank the morning air."</p>

<p>The other convicts, forgetful of themselves
and their crimes, watch with silent amazement
"The man who had to swing." He still carries
himself bravely and they can hardly realise that
he will so soon be swept into eternity; and then
a perfectly mediæval note is struck&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"For oak and elm have pleasant leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i5">That in the springtime shoot:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But grim to see is the gallows-tree<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And green or dry a man must die<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Before it bears its fruit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There we have the true spirit of the old ballads.
The comparison between the oak and elm in the
spring putting forth their leaves, and the gaunt,
bare timber of the gibbet with its burden of dead
human fruit is a highly imaginative and artistic
piece of fantasy, though possibly a poem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Villon's was in Wilde's mind at the time of
writing.</p>

<p>He gives us in the next stanza a picture of the
murderer with noose adjusted to his neck, taking
his last look upon the world, and the drop suggests
another finely imaged comparison to him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"'Tis sweet to dance to violins<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When Love and Life are fair,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and goes on so for another two lines before he
brings in the antithesis&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br /></span>
<span class="i5">To dance upon the air."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The almost morbid fascination the sight of
this man with his foot in the grave exercises
over him is undiminished, till one day he misses
him and knows that he is standing "In black
dock's dreadful pen." He himself had been
through that dread ordeal and his spirit goes out
to him whom he had seen daily for a brief space
without ever holding commune with him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br /></span>
<span class="i5">We had crossed each other's way,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he writes, and proceeds to explain that it was
impossible for them to exchange word or sign,
as they never saw each other in the "holy" night
but in the "shameful" day. In a passage of
rare beauty, one of the finest in the poem, he
explains&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"A prison wall was round us both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i5">Two outcast men we were<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The world had thrust us from his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And God from out His care:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Had caught us in its snare."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lines in their supreme reticence indicate
precisely the agony and despair that filled the
heart of C33, and once again a comparison with
"Eugene Aram" is forced upon us.</p>

<p>The third period starts with a picture of the
doomed man and a scathing bit of satire directed
against the prison officials. The wretch is shown
to us watched day and night by keen, sleepless
eyes, debarred even for a brief second of the
privilege of being alone with his thoughts and
his misery.</p>

<p>Then a small detail is introduced to heighten
the effect of the grim picture&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"And thrice a day he smoked his pipe<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And drank his quart of beer."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is quite a Shakespearean note in this
introduction of these commonplace details, which
proves how thoroughly Oscar Wilde had studied
the methods of the great dramatist.</p>

<p>But he leaves the condemned cell to paint the
effect the whole ghastly tragedy being enacted
within those grey walls had upon the other
prisoners. To a highly strung and supersensitive
nature like the writer's the strain must have
been terrible. The captives went through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
allotted tasks of picking oakum till the fingers bled,
scrubbing the floors, polishing the rails, sewing
sacks, and all the other daily routine of prison life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"But in the heart of every man<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Terror was lying still&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>until one day, returning from their labours, they
"passed an open grave," and they knew that the
execution would take place on the morrow. They
saw the hangman with his black bag shuffling
through the gloom, and like cowed hounds they
crept silently back to their cells. Then night
comes and Fear stalks through the prison, but
the man himself is wrapt in peaceful slumbers.
The watching warders cannot make out</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"How one could sleep so sweet a sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a hangman close at hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not so with the other prisoners&mdash;"the fool, the
fraud, the knave"&mdash;sleep is banished from their
cells, they are feeling another's guilt, and the
hardened hearts melt at the thought of another's
agony. The warders, making their noiseless
round, are surprised as they look through the
wickets to see "gray figures on the floor." They
are puzzled and wonder&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Why men knelt to pray<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who never prayed before."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All through the long night they keep their sacred
vigil.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"The grey cock crew, the red cock crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i5">But never came the day,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and their imaginations people the corners and
shadows with shapes of terror. The marionette
dance of death of these ghostly visitants is as
fine a bit of word-painting as can be found any
where. The idea is an amplification of the
<i>motif</i> of "The Harlot's House," but how immeasurably
superior, how much more artistically
effective the most cursory comparison of the two
poems will make apparent.</p>

<p>At last the first faint streaks of day steal
through the prison bars and the daily task of
cleaning the cells is performed as usual, but the
Angel of Death passes through the prison, and
with parched throats the prisoners, who were
kept in their cells while the grim tragedy was
being enacted, wait for the stroke of eight, the
hour fixed for the carrying out of the sentence.
As the first chimes of the prison clock are heard
a moan arises from those imprisoned wretches.
At noon they are marched out into the yard,
and each man's eye is turned wistfully to the
sky, just as the condemned man's had been.
They notice that the warders are wearing their
best uniforms, but the task they have just been
engaged upon is revealed "by the quicklime on
their boots." The murderer has expiated his crime,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"And the crimson stain that was of Cain<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Became Christ's snow-white seal."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his dishonoured grave he lies in a winding-sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of quicklime; no rose or flower shall bloom
above it, no tear shall water it, no prayer or
benison be uttered over it.</p>

<p>"In Reading Gaol by Reading Town," with a
repetition of the stanza embodying the theme
that "all men kill the thing they love," the poem
ends.</p>

<p>Truly a wonderful poem this. We close the
covers of the book slowly, almost reverently, our
minds all saddened and attuned to a low note by
this gloomy picture of agony, torture and horror.
We feel as if we had been assisting at a funeral,
and with hushed voices slowly make our way
back to the world of life and bustle.</p>

<p>Wilde's place in poetry has yet to be settled,
we have not yet had time to focus his work into
perspective. That he will rank amongst the
very greatest creative geniuses of the world, the
men whose songs sway nations, is doubtful,
though time alone can tell us.</p>

<p>The least that can be said is that there is a
distinction about Wilde's poetry that will always
stamp it as the work of a great artist, and as such
it commands a high place amongst the best
literary work that this country has produced.</p>

<h2><a name="FICTION" id="FICTION"></a>FICTION</h2>


<p>That the gift of composing beautiful verse and
the ability to write gracefully and wittily in prose
does not of necessity enable an author to produce
good fiction, is a truism that requires no elaboration.
That the novelist should possess style is
a <i>sine quâ non</i>&mdash;that is, if his novels are to take
their place as works of art and not merely achieve
an ephemeral success amongst the patrons of circulating
libraries&mdash;but to achieve distinction in
the field of romance many other qualities are
requisite. To begin with, the story must be of
sufficient interest to hold the attention of the
reader, the dialogue must be brisk and to the
point, and the delineation of character&mdash;a gift
in itself&mdash;lifelike and convincing.</p>

<p>Whether Oscar Wilde would, had his life been
prolonged, have ever achieved success in this
branch of literature is one of those vexed questions
which may well be left to those speculative
persons who love to discuss "The Mystery of
Edwin Drood" and other unfinished works of
fiction. That he was endowed with an extraordinarily
vivid imagination and that his versatility
was marvellous are factors that no one
should neglect to take into account when considering
the matter. His own contributions to
fiction are so few that they afford very little data<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to go upon. They consist of "The Picture of
Dorian Gray," published in 1890; "Lord Arthur
Savile's Crime"; "The Incomparable and Ingenious
History of Mr W. H., being the true
secret of Shakespeare's Sonnets, now for the
first time here fully set forth," the manuscript of
which, after passing through the hands of Messrs
Elkin Mathews and John Lane, publishers, who
had announced the work as being in preparation,
has been unaccountably lost, although it is
known that it was returned to the author's
house on the very day of his arrest. An article
in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> alone enables us to
gather some idea of the last work. Then we
have three short stories&mdash;"The Sphinx without
a Secret," "The Canterville Ghost," "The Model
Millionaire," which complete the list of Wilde's
fiction in the limited sense of the word.</p>

<p>A careful study of these remains must lead to
the inevitable conclusion that, so far as we can
judge by these more or less fragmentary specimens,
Wilde's <i>forte</i> was not fiction. He can in
no sense be regarded as a novelist, certainly not
as an exponent of modern fiction. The pieces
are brilliantly clever, gemmed with paradoxes
and quaint turns of thought, but they are not
fiction in the accepted sense of the word. Works
of imagination, yes, but "fiction," no. That he
was a graceful allegorist nobody can deny, but
that his work in this other field of letters was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
great is never for a moment to be even suggested.
He used fiction as a means of introducing his
curiously topsy-turvy views of life, but his
characters are mere puppets, strange creatures
with unreal names, without any particular personality
or especially characteristic features, who
enunciate the author's views and opinions.</p>

<p>In a preface to "Dorian Gray," when it was
published in book form, Oscar Wilde himself
confirms this view&mdash;"The highest and the lowest
form of criticism," he tells us, "is a mode of
autobiography." That he himself believed in
the artistic value of his story is evident from the
series of brilliant aphorisms which constitute the
preface.</p>

<p>When in July, 1890, there appeared in an
American magazine the fantastic story of
"Dorian Gray" an astonished public rubbed
its eyes and wondered whether all its previous
theories as to this class of work had been
absolutely false and should henceforth be discarded
like a garment that has gone out of
fashion.</p>

<p>The story provoked a storm of criticism which,
for the most part, only served to increase the
sale of the magazine in which it appeared. In
answer to his critics the author contented himself
with the dictum that "Diversity of opinion about
a work of art shows that the work is new, complex,
and vital." Whether "The Picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Dorian Gray" possessed these three essential
qualities is a question which may best be answered
by giving a short <i>resume</i> of the story itself.
Basil Hallward, a young artist who, some years
previously, had caused a great sensation by his
disappearance, has painted a full-length portrait
of a young man of "extraordinary personal
beauty." In conversation with Lord Henry
Wotton, who is visiting the studio, he inadvertently
reveals that it is the portrait of Dorian
Gray, and alleges as his reason for not exhibiting
the picture that he has put too much of himself
into it; and, pressed for an explanation, he tells
the story of his meeting the original of the painting
at a Society function, and how deeply he had
been impressed by his extraordinary personality.
He experiences a "curious artistic idolatry" for
the young man, and as they are discussing him
the servant announces "Mr Dorian Gray." We
then get a word-picture of this interesting young
man, we are told that there was something in his
face which made you trust him, that it was full
of the candour of youth and passionate purity.
During the sitting that follows, Lord Henry
enunciates his views of life, and his words leave
a deep impression on his youthful auditor.
Dorian's acquaintance with Lord Henry soon
ripens into friendship, and he confides to his
friend that he has fallen deeply in love with
Sybil Vane, a young actress he has accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
discovered in an East End playhouse.</p>

<p>Late upon the same night on which the confidence
was made Lord Henry finds, on his
return home, a telegram from Dorian Gray
announcing his engagement to the object of his
affections. We are next introduced to Sybil's
shabby home in the Euston Road; to her mother,
a faded, tired-looking woman with bismuth-whitened
hands, and to her brother, a young lad
with a thick-set figure, rough brown hair and
large hands and feet "somewhat clumsy in movement."
The faded beauty of the elder woman
and her theatrical gestures and manners are
deftly touched upon. The son, whom we learn
is about to seek his fortune in Australia, goes
with his sister for a walk in the park, and
their talk is all of her love for Dorian, of which
he does not approve. Sybil catches sight of her
lover, but before she can point him out to her
brother he is lost to sight. They return home;
the lad's heart is filled with jealousy, and a fierce
murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it
seemed to him, had come between him and his
sister. Downstairs he startles his mother with a
sudden question&mdash;"Were you married to my
father?" The woman had been dreading the
question for years, but she answers it in the
negative, and tells him that his parent was a
gentleman and highly connected, but not free to
marry her. In the meanwhile, Lord Henry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Basil are discussing the proposed marriage in the
private room of a fashionable restaurant, and
presently they are joined by Dorian himself, who
takes part in the discussion, till it is time for
them to go to the theatre. His two friends are
delighted with the beauty of his <i>fiancée</i>, but her
acting is below mediocrity, and the boy, who has
seen her act really well on previous occasions, is
terrible disconcerted.</p>

<p>Later, in the green-room, Sybil explains the
reason of this falling off. She is quite candid
about it: she tells him she will never act well
again, because he has transfigured her life, and
that acting, which had before been a matter of
reality to her, had become a hollow sham, and
that she can no longer mimic a passion that
burns her like fire. Flinging himself down on a
seat, Dorian exclaims, "You have killed my
love," and after an impassioned tirade answers
his own question of "What are you now?" with
"A third-rate actress with a pretty face." In
vain she pleads for his love; he leaves her telling
her that he can never see her again, for she has
disappointed him. When, after wandering aimlessly
about all night, he returns home, he is suddenly
conscious of a change in the portrait Basil
had painted of him. The expression is different,
and there are lines of cruelty round the mouth,
though he can trace no such lines in his own face.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, there flashed across his mind what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day
the picture had been finished.... He had
uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain
young and the portrait grow old, that his own
beauty might be untarnished and the face on the
canvas bear the burden of his passions and his
sins." He is struck with remorse for his cruelty
to Sybil, and by the time Lord Henry comes to
see him has determined to atone for it by marrying
her, but it is too late. He learns from his
friend's lips that Sybil has committed suicide in
the theatre shortly after he had left her.</p>

<p>He spends the evening at the opera with Lord
Henry Wotton, and his sister, Lady Gwendolen.
When, next day, he mentions this to Basil the
latter is horrified, but Dorian is perfectly callous
and is inclined to be flattered by the fact that
the girl should have committed suicide for love
of him.</p>

<p>Basil wishes to look at the picture, which he
intends to exhibit in Paris, and before which
Dorian has placed a screen, but the latter will
not let him see it, and the former presently goes
away greatly puzzled by the refusal. When he
is gone Dorian sends for a framemaker, and gets
him and his assistant to remove the draped
picture to a disused room in his house, having
previously sent his man out with a note to Lord
Henry in order to get him out of the way. Having
dismissed the framemaker and his assistant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
he carefully locks the door of the room and retains
the key. When he comes down, he finds that
Lord Henry has sent him a paper containing an
account of the inquest on Sybil, and an unhealthy
French book which fascinates whilst it repels
him, and the influence of which he cannot shake
off for years after.</p>

<p>Time passes, but the hero of the story shows
no signs of growing older, nor does he lose his
good looks. Meanwhile, the most evil rumours
as to his mode of life are in circulation. We
learn that he is in the habit of frequenting, disguised
and under an assumed name, a little ill-famed
tavern near the docks, and we are given a
long analysis of his mental and spiritual condition,
whilst his various idiosyncrasies are carefully
recorded, and we are insensibly reminded
of the surroundings invented for himself by the
hero of Huysman's "A Rebours."</p>

<p>All the while, the picture remains hidden
away, a very skeleton in the cupboard. Dorian
Gray is nearly blackballed for a West End
Club, Society looks askance at him, and there
are all sorts of ugly rumours current as to his
doings and movements.</p>

<p>One night he meets Hallward, who wants to
talk to him about his mode of life. The painter
enumerates all the scandalous stories he has
heard about him; he ends up by expressing a
doubt whether he really knows his friend. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
do so, he says, he should have to see his soul.
"You shall see it yourself to-night," Dorian
exclaims, "it is your handiwork," and, holding a
lamp, he takes him up to the locked room,
and removes the drapery from the picture. An
exclamation of horror breaks from the painter
as he perceives the hideous face on the canvas
grinning at him. It fills him with loathing and
disgust, and he has difficulty in believing it to
be his own work. Dorian is seized with an uncontrollable
feeling of hatred for his friend, and,
seizing a knife lying on a chest, stabs him in the
neck and kills him. After the murder he locks
the door, and goes quietly downstairs. He slips
out into the street closing the front door very
gently, and rings the bell. When his valet
opens it he explains that he had left his latchkey
indoors, and casually inquires the time, which
the man informs him is ten minutes past two.</p>

<p>The next day Dorian sends for a former friend
of his, Alan Campbell, whose hobby is chemistry,
and after telling him of the murder, begs him
by some chemical process to destroy the body.
Alan refuses to help him. Dorian then writes
something upon a piece of paper and gives it to
the other to read. Alan is terror-struck and
consents to do what is required of him, though
reluctantly. When later, provided with the
necessary chemicals, they enter the locked room,
Dorian perceives that the hands of the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
are stained with blood.</p>

<p>He dines out that night, and when he returns
home he provides himself with some opium paste
he keeps locked up in a secret drawer, and having
dressed himself in rough garments makes
his way to the docks. He enters an opium den,
but the presence of a man who owes his downfall
to him irritates him, and he decides to go to
another. A woman greets him with the title
"Prince Charming" (the name Sybil had given
him), and on hearing it a sailor gets up from his
seat and follows him. In a dim archway he feels
himself seized by the throat and sees a revolver
pointed at his head. Briefly, his assailant tells
him that he is Sybil's brother, and that he means
to avenge his sister's death. A sudden inspiration
comes to Dorian and he inquires of
the man how long it is since his sister died.
"Eighteen years," is the answer, and Gray
triumphantly exclaims "Look at my face." He
is dragged under a lamp, and at sight of the
youthful face Sybil's brother is convinced that
he has made a mistake. Hardly has Dorian
gone, when the woman who had called him
Prince Charming comes up, and from her the
sailor learns that in eighteen years Dorian has
not altered.</p>

<p>Dorian goes down to his country house, where
he entertains a large party of guests, though all
the while he lives in deadly terror lest Sybil's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
brother should trace him. During a <i>battue</i> a
man is accidentally shot by one of Dorian's
guests. It is at first thought that the victim
of the accident is one of the beaters but it turns
out to be a stranger, a seafaring man presumably.
Dorian goes to look at the body, and to
his intense relief finds that the dead man is his
assailant of some nights back.</p>

<p>Back in London one night Dorian Gray
determines that he will reform, and, curious to
see whether his good resolutions have had any
effect on the portrait, he goes up to look at it.
No, it still bears the same repulsive look, and in
a rage he stabs at it with the knife with which
he had murdered Basil. A loud agonised cry
rings through the house, and when the servants
at last make their way into the room they find
hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of
their master as they had last seen him, while
lying on the floor with a knife through his heart
was a dead man "withered, wrinkled, and loathsome
of visage," whom they could only identify
by the rings on his fingers.</p>

<p>Such, shorn of all its brilliant dialogue and
exquisite descriptive passages, is the story of
"The Portrait of Dorian Gray," in its bald
outlines. As an imaginative work it must
rank high, and in spite of the fantastic character
of the plot and its inherent improbability, it
exercises a weird fascination over us as we read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
That its author (more even in the treatment than
in the plot) was inspired by Balzac's incomparable
"Peau de Chagrin" is beyond question.
In the one story we have a man purchasing a
piece of shagreen skin inscribed with Sanskrit
characters which, as each of its possessor's desires
are gratified, by its shrinkage marks a diminution
in the span of his life. In the other, whilst
the original man remains outwardly unchanged,
his portrait ages with the years and reveals in its
features all the passions and sins that gradually
transform his nature. In both cases the story
ends in tragedy.</p>

<p>The colouring of the tale is one of its most
remarkable features. In passages of rare beauty
Oscar Wilde gives us descriptions of jewels and
perfumes, rare tapestries and quaint musical instruments.
The catalogue of the jewels as set
out by him deserves to be quoted for the
marvellous knowledge of precious stones it
reveals as well as for the exquisite description
of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>"He would often spend a whole day settling
and resettling in the cases the various stones
that he had collected, such as the olive-green
chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the
cymophane with its wirelike line of silver, the
pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow
topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with
tremulous four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts
with the alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.
He loved the red-gold of the sunstone, and the
moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken
rainbow of the milky opal. He procured from
Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size
and richness of colour, and had a turquoise <i>de
la vicille roche</i> that was the envy of all connoisseurs."</p></blockquote>

<p>It may here be pointed out, though the fact is
not generally known, that Wilde's knowledge of
tapestry which, at first sight, seems so profound,
was obtained from Lefebure's "History of
Embroidery and Lace," a book which he had
reviewed in an article having for title "A
Fascinating Book." It is interesting to compare
an extract from that article with a passage
from the review under discussion:</p>

<p>Wilde, who at times was extremely indolent,
had an amiable weakness for using the material
at hand, and throughout his writings we find
whole lines of verse and prose sentences reappearing
in work produced at another period. It
is the same with the epigrams in "Dorian Gray,"
most of which were subsequently transferred,
bodily, to his plays. During his travels in Italy,
as I have already pointed out, he had been
enormously impressed by the stately ceremonials
of the Catholic Church, and in this book he uses
his opportunity of introducing the ornate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
sumptuous vestments worn at her services.
Dorian Gray, he tells us, "had a special passion
also for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he
had for everything connected with the service
of the Church. In the long cedar chests that
lined the west gallery of his house he had stored
away many rare and beautiful specimens of what
is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who
must wear purples and jewels and fine linen
that she may hide the pallid macerated body
that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for,
and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He had a
gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread
damask, figured with a repeating pattern of
golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal
blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
pineapple device wrought in seed-pearls. The
orphreys were divided into panels representing
scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation
of the Virgin was figured in coloured
silks upon the hood. This was Italian work
of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of
green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped
groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread
long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of
which were picked out with silver thread and
coloured crystals. The morse bore a seraph's
head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys
were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and
were starred with medallions of many saints and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
martyrs, among whom was St Sebastian. He
had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk,
and blue silk and gold brocades, and yellow
silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
representation of the Passion and Crucifixion
of Christ, and embroidered with lions
and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics
of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated
with tulips and dolphins and <i>fleurs de
lys</i>; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue
linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and
sudaria."</p>

<p>It may also be noted here that a couple of
chapters, those dealing with Sybil's home and
the death of her brother, were not written till
the story appeared in book form, and a certain
extra number of words were required to make
the volume of the requisite bulk; so must
writers submit to the inexorable demands of
publishers who measure work not by its merit
but by a footrule.</p>

<p>The dialogue throughout the tale sparkles
with brilliant epigrams, and this is all the more
notable when we remember that the story was
written in a hurry, when the author was hard
pressed for money, is more or less a piece of
hack work, and that whole pages were written
in at the behest of the publisher, who, like a
customer at the baker's demanding the make-weight
which the law allows him, was clamouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
for more "copy."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more felicitous than "young
people imagine that money is everything ...
and when they grow older they know it"; and,
"to be good is to be in harmony with oneself."
And characteristic of that Epicurean pose that
the author delighted in is the paradoxical dictum
that "a cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect
pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied."
Likewise essentially characteristic of
the man and his extraordinary, topsy-turvy
views of life is, "There is a fatality about good
resolutions&mdash;that they are always made too late,"
or "Good resolutions are useless attempts to
interfere with scientific laws. They are simply
cheques that men draw on a bank where they
have no account."</p>

<p>Some of the epigrams are as biting as a
<i>Saturday Review</i> article, in the old days, as for
instance, this description of a certain frail dame&mdash;"She
is still <i>decolletée</i>, and when she is in a
very smart gown she looks like an <i>edition de luxe</i>
of a bad French novel." Could anything be
more pithy or more brilliantly sarcastic? It is
of this same lady that the remark is made,
"When her third husband died, her hair turned
quite golden from grief."</p>

<p>But one could go on for ever, and I have
quoted enough to illustrate the wittiness of the
dialogue, and, as the author himself lays down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
"Enough is as good as a meal." And there, by
the way, we have an illustration of how cleverly
Wilde could transform the commonest saws by
the alteration or the transposition of a word,
even sometimes by the inversion of a sentence
into what, at the first flush, appeared to be highly
original and brilliant sayings. By the substitution
of the word "meal" for "feast" we fail to
recognise the old homely saying, and are ready,
until we consider it more closely, to receive it as
a new and witty idea neatly embodied. It is a
<i>truc de métier</i>, but one that requires a clever
workman to use properly, as anyone can make
sure of by glancing through the bungling work
of the majority of his imitators.</p>

<p>In "Dorian Gray," Wilde gives free play to
his ever-present longing to utter the <i>dernier
cri</i>, to avoid all that was <i>vieux jeu</i>, and to fill
with horror and amazement the souls of the
stodgy <i>bourgeoisie</i>. That he succeeded in doing
so merely proves that the <i>bourgeoisie</i> are stodgy,
not that the author has erred from the canons of
art and good taste.</p>

<p>His short stories are all written in a lighter
vein&mdash;we peruse them as we eat a plover's egg,
and with the same relish and appreciation. They
are things of gossamer, but gossamer will oft survive
more solid material, and has the supreme
quality of delicacy.</p>

<p>"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime" deals with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
nobleman's anxiety to commit the murder a
cheiromantist has predicted he will perpetrate,
and to get the matter over before he marries the
girl to whom he is engaged. His two successive
failures and his final drowning of the hand-reading
fortune-teller is conceived in the best spirit
of comedy, and provokes a gentle continuous
ripple of amusement as we read it. The same
may be said of "The Sphinx without a Secret,"
and "The Canterville Ghost," whereas the "Model
Millionaire" is simply a pretty story wittily told.
The whole plot is summed up in its concluding
lines "Millionaire models are rare enough ...
but model millionaires are rarer still."</p>

<p>But, incomparably, Wilde's best work in fiction
is the "Portrait of Mr W. H." as the <i>Blackwood</i>
article is headed. After reading it our regret
becomes all the more poignant that the complete
MS. of the book should have so unaccountably
disappeared. Correctly speaking, the story
is hardly a work of fiction, or, at anyrate, the
fiction is so slight as to be hardly deserving of
criticism, and is a mere medium for the exposition
of a theory. The teller of the story is in a
friend's rooms, and the talk drifts on to literary
forgeries. The friend (Erskine) shows him a
portrait-panel of a young man in late sixteenth-century
costume, and proceeds to tell him his
story. A young friend of his had discovered
what he considered a clue to the identity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Mr W. H. of Shakespeare's Sonnets, the only
hitch being the difficulty of proving that the
young actor to whom he asserted his poems were
written, ever existed. He shortly afterwards
produced a panel-portrait of the young man
which he had, as he alleged, discovered clamped
to the inside of an old chest picked up by him
at a Warwickshire farmhouse. This final proof
quite convinced Erskine of the genuineness of
the discovery, and it was not till an accidental
visit to a friend's studio that the fact of the panel
being a forgery was revealed to him. He taxes
the discoverer of the clue with it and the latter
commits suicide. The writer of the story is so
impressed with the various proofs that Erskine
has laid before him that, in spite of that latter's
utter scepticism as to the existence of any such
person as the dead man evolved from the Sonnets
themselves, he completes the researches on his
own account. But the moment he has sent off
a detailed account of the result of his investigations
to Erskine, he himself is filled with an utter
disbelief in the accuracy of the conclusions derived
from them. Erskine, on the other hand,
is once more converted by his letter to his dead
friend's theory.</p>

<p>Two years later the writer receives a letter
from Erskine written from Cannes stating that,
like the discoverer of the clue, he has committed
suicide for the sake of a theory which he leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
to his friend as a sacred legacy stained with the
blood of two lives. The writer rushes off to the
Riviera only to find his friend dead, and to receive
from his mother the ill-starred panel.</p>

<p>The story ends with a true Wilde touch, for
in a conversation with the doctor who had attended
him, he learns that Erskine had died of
consumption and had never committed suicide
at all.</p>

<p>So much for the setting, which is quite unimportant.
The real matter of moment is, that the
<i>Blackwood</i> article is a really very valuable contribution
to the controversy as to the identity of
the mysterious Mr W. H.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Sonnets were
first issued in book form in 1609, by a sort of
piratical bookseller of those days, called Thames
Thorpe who, on his own responsibility, prefixed
the edition with a dedication&mdash;"To the only-begotten
of these insuing sonnets, Mr W. H.,
all happinesse and that eternite promised by our
ever living poet wisheth the well wishing adventurer
in setting forth. T. T." Round the
identity of this W. H. there has long raged an
ardent controversy. Most of the commentators
have rushed to the conclusion that he must be
the person to whom the Sonnets are addressed.
Some have attempted to identify him as Henry
Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton (the initials
being reversed), who is known to have been an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
early patron of the poet, others without much
apparent reason have assumed that the W. H.
in question was none other than William Herbert,
Earl of Pembroke. The most probable theory
is undoubtedly that of Mr Henry Lee, that the
dedication is entirely Thorpe's own, that it has
nothing whatever to do with Shakespeare or the
inspirer of the poet, and that it was meant for
William Hall, a sort of literary intermediary.
In confirmation of this he adduces the undoubted
fact that Thorpe had, at anyrate, once previously
dedicated a work to its "begotten."</p>

<p>One point is established almost beyond dispute&mdash;viz.
that the first 126 sonnets are addressed to
a young man and the remainder refer to a "dark
woman" who, after having bewitched the author,
casts her spell over his young friend and estranges
the two.</p>

<p>A counter-theory is that Shakespeare's selection
of the sonnet, "that puling, petrifying,
stupidly platonic composition," as Byron calls it,
as a medium for his muse, is that he was experimenting
in the style of writing which had become
the fashion in England between the years 1591
and 1597.</p>

<p>Wilde's history is a totally new one, and
deserves close examination. Given that it could
be proved that the young actor to whom he
maintains the Sonnets were addressed ever had
a real existence, and the matter would be as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
as proved, but that is the weak point in his armour.
Mayhap some enthusiast may, by digging amongst
old deeds and papers, light upon some reference
to him, but until then his hypothesis can be only
regarded as an ingenious, though highly interesting
speculation. Parenthetically it may be mentioned,
although the fact is only known to very
few, that an artist friend of Oscar Wilde, whose
work is the admiration of all connoisseurs, had,
under his direction, painted exactly such a panel-portrait
as described, employing all the arts of
the forger of antiquities in its production, and
that a young poet whose recently published
volume of verse had caused considerable sensation
in literary circles had sat for the likeness.</p>

<p>The points Wilde advances in confirmation of
his theory are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. That the young man to whom Shakespeare
addresses sonnets must have been someone who
was really a vital factor in the development of
his dramatic art, and that this could not be said
of either Lord Pembroke or Lord Southampton.</p>

<p>2. That the Sonnets, as we learn from Meres,
were written before 1598 and that his friendship
with W. H. had already lasted three years when
Sonnet CIV. was written, which would fix the
date of its commencement as 1594, or at latest
1595, that Lord Pembroke was born in 1580 and
did not come to London till he was eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
(<i>i.e.</i> 1598) so that Shakespeare could not have
met him till after the sonnet had been written;
and that Pembroke's father did not die till
1601, whereas W. H.'s father was dead in 1598,
as is proved by the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You had a father, let your son say so."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>3. That Lord Southampton had early in life
become the lover of Elizabeth Vernon, so required
no urging to enter the state of matrimony, that
he was not dowered with good looks, and that
he did not remember his mother as W. H. did.
(Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
calls back the lovely April of her prime), and
moreover that his Christian name being Henry
he could not be the Will to whom the punning
sonnets (CXXXV. and CXLIII.) are addressed.</p>

<p>4. That W. H. is none other than the boy
actor for whom Shakespeare created the parts of
Viola, Imogen, Juliet, Rosalind, Portia, Desdemona
and Cleopatra.</p>

<p>5. That the boy's name was Hughes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These points he proves from the Sonnets themselves.
As regards No. 1 he writes: "to look
upon him as simply the object of certain love
poems is to miss the whole meaning of the
poems; for the art of which Shakespeare talks
in the Sonnets is not the art of the Sonnets
themselves, which indeed were to him but slight
and secret things, it is the art of the dramatist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to which he is always alluding. He proceeds to
quote the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"Thou art all my art and dost advance<br /></span>

English literature no student of letters

<p class="center bigger">THE PHILOSOPHY OF BEAUTY</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PHILOSOPHY OF BEAUTY</h2>


<p>The greatest claim that Wilde made for himself
was that he was a high priest of æsthetics, that
he had a new message concerning the relations
of beauty and the worship of beauty to life and
art, to life and to morals to give to the world.
This claim was one in which to the last he pathetically
believed. He was absolutely certain in his
own mind that this was his vocation. He elaborated
a sort of philosophy of beauty which not only
pleased and satisfied himself, but found very many
adherents, and became the dogma of a school.</p>

<p>Even in this last work, "De Profundis,"
written in the middle of his degradation and
misery, he still believes that it is by art that
he will be able to regenerate his spirit. He said
that he would do such work in the future, would
build beautiful things out of his sufferings, that
he might cry in triumph&mdash;"Yes! This is just
where the artistic life leads a man."</p>

<p>We all know where the artistic life did lead
Oscar Wilde upon his release from prison. It
led him to an obscure quarter of Paris where he
dragged out the short remainder of an unhappy
life, having written nothing save "The Ballad of
Reading Gaol," and becoming more and more
lost to finer aspirations.</p>

<p>Yet, nevertheless, this æsthetic philosophy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Wilde's forms one of the most important parts
of his writings, and of his attitude towards life.
It must, therefore, be carefully considered in
any study of the man and his work.</p>

<p>First of all, let us inquire, what are æsthetics?
Do not let anyone who has not given his attention
to the subject imagine that the "æstheticism,"
which became known as the hallmark of
a band of people led by Oscar Wilde who committed
many whimsical extravagances, and who
were caricatured in Mr Gilbert's "Patience," has
any relation whatever to the science of æsthetics.
Even to Oscar Wilde æstheticism, as it has been
popularly called, was only the beginning of an
æsthetic philosophy which he summed up finally
much later in "Intentions," the "Poems in
Prose," and "The Soul of Man under Socialism."</p>

<p>By æsthetics is meant a theory of the beautiful
as exhibited in works of art. That is to say,
æsthetics considered on its objective side has to
investigate, first, a function of art in general as
expressing the beautiful, and then the nature of
the beauty thus expressed.</p>

<p>Secondly, the special functions of the several
arts are investigated by æsthetics and the special
aspects of the beautiful with which they are
severally concerned. It, therefore, follows that
æsthetics has to discuss such topics as the relation
of art to nature and life, the distinction of
art from nature, the relation of natural to artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
beauty, the conditions and nature of beauty in
a work of art, and especially the distinction of
beauty from truth, from utility, and from moral
goodness.</p>

<p>Æsthetics is, therefore, not art criticism. Art
criticism deals with this or that particular work
or type of art, while the æsthetic theory seeks to
formulate the mere abstract and fundamental
conceptions, distinctions, and principles which
underlie artistic criticism, and alone make it
possible. Art criticism is the link between
æsthetic science and the ordinary intelligent
appreciation of a work of art by an ordinary
intelligence. Much more may be said in defining
the functions of æsthetics, but this is
sufficient before we begin to examine Wilde's
own æsthetic theories.</p>

<p>His ideas were promulgated in the three
works mentioned above, and also given to the
world in lectures which he delivered at various
times.</p>

<p>It is true, as Mr Arthur Symons very clearly
pointed out some years ago, that Oscar Wilde
wrote much that was true, new, and valuable
about art and the artist. But in everything that
he wrote he wrote from the outside. He said
nothing which had not been said before him, or
which was not the mere wilful contrary of what
had been said before him. Indeed, it is not too
much to say that Oscar Wilde never saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
full face of beauty. He saw it always in profile,
always in a limited way. The pretence of strict
logic in Wilde's writing on "Artistic Philosophy"
is only a pretence, and severe and steady
thinkers recognise the fallacy.</p>

<p>Let us examine Oscar Wilde's æsthetic
teaching.</p>

<p>In one of his lectures given in America he
said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"And now I would point out to you the
operation of the artistic spirit in the choice of
subject. Like the philosopher of the platonic
vision, the poet is the spectator of all time and
all existence. For him no form is obsolete, no
subject out of date; rather, whatever of life and
passion the world has known in the desert of
Judea or in Arcadian valley, by the ruins of
Troy or Damascus, in the crowded and hideous
streets of the modern city, or by the pleasant
ways of Camelot, all lies before him like an open
scroll, all is still instinct with beautiful life. He
will take of it what is salutary for his own spirit,
choosing some facts and rejecting others, with the
calm artistic control of one who is in possession
of the secret of beauty. It is to no avail that
the muse of poetry be called even by such a
clarion note as Whitman's to migrate from
Greece and Ionia and to placard 'removed' and
'to let' on the rocks of the snowy Parnassus.
For art, to quote a noble passage of Mr Swinburne's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
is very life itself and knows nothing
of death. And so it comes that he who seems
to stand most remote from his age is he who
mirrors it best, because he has stripped life of
that mist of familiarity, which, as Shelley used
to say, makes life obscure to us.</p>

<p>"Whatever spiritual message an artist brings
to his age, it is for us to do naught but accept his
teaching. You have most of you seen probably
that great masterpiece of Rubens which hangs
in the gallery of Brussels, that swift and wonderful
pageant of horse and rider, arrested in its
most exquisite and fiery moment, when the
winds are caught in crimson banner and the air
is lit by the gleam of armour and the flash of
plume. Well, that is joy in art, though that
golden hillside be trodden by the wounded feet
of Christ; and it is for the death of the Son of
Man that that gorgeous cavalcade is passing.</p>

<p>"In the primary aspect a painting has no more
spiritual message than an exquisite fragment of
Venetian glass. The channels by which all
noble and imaginative work in painting should
touch the soul are not those of the truths of
lives. This should be done by a certain inventive
and creative handling entirely independent
of anything definitely poetical in the
subject, something entirely satisfying in itself,
which is, as the Greeks would say, in itself an
end. So the joy of poetry comes never from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the subject, but from an inventive handling of
rhythmical language."</p></blockquote>

<p>And further he said that "in nations as in
individuals, if the passion for creation be not
accompanied by the critical, the æsthetic faculty
also, it will be sure to waste its strength. It is
not an increased moral sense or moral supervision
that your literature needs. Indeed one
should never talk of a moral or immoral poem.
Poems are either well written or badly written;
that is all. Any element of morals or implied
reference to a standard of good and evil in art is
often a sign of a certain incompleteness of vision.
All good work aims at a purely artistic effect."</p>

<p>In "Intentions" he enunciated serious problems
which seemed constantly to contradict
themselves, and he causes ourselves to ask questions
which only bewilder and astonish. To sum
up all the æsthetic teaching of the author it
amounts simply and solely to the aphorism that
there must be a permanent divorce between art
and morals. "All art," he says, "is immoral."</p>

<p>Some people have taken the view that Oscar
Wilde in his philosophy of beauty was never
quite sincere. He did not write for philistines
with his heart in his mouth, but merely with his
tongue in his cheek. I remember Mr Richard
Le Gallienne once said that in "Intentions"
Wilde's worship of beauty, which had made a
latter-day myth of him before his time, was overlaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
by his gift of comic perception, and, rightly
viewed, all his flute-tone periods were written in
the service of the comic muse. When he was
not of malice aforethought humorous in those
parts of the work where he seems to be arguing
with a serious face enough, it is implied that he
did so simply that he might smile behind his
mask at the astonishment of a public he had
from the first so delighted in shocking&mdash;that
he had a passion for being called "dangerous,"
just as one type of man likes to be called "fast"
and a "rake."</p>

<p>This is, of course, one point of view, but it is
not one with which I am in agreement. Wilde
laid such enormous stress upon the sensuous side
of art, and never realised that this is but an exterior
aspect which is impossible and could not
exist without a spiritual interior, an informing
soul.</p>

<p>With all his brilliancy the author of "Intentions"
only saw a mere fragment of his subject.
It may be that he wilfully shut his eyes to the
truth. It is more likely that he was incapable
of realising the truth as a whole, and that what
he wrote he wrote with absolute sincerity.</p>

<p>It has been said that the artist sees farther
than morality. This is a dangerous doctrine for
the artist himself to believe, but it has some
truth in it. In Oscar Wilde's case, in pursuing
the ideal of beauty he may have seen "farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
than morality," but blind of one eye he missed
Morality upon the way and did not realise that
she was ever there.</p>

<p>It is the fashion nowadays among a certain set
of writers, who form the remainder of the band
of "Æsthetes" who followed Wilde in his teachings,
to decry Ruskin, though, in the beginning
of Wilde's "Æsthetic" movement, Wilde was
an ardent pupil of this great master of English
prose. We do not now accept Ruskin's artistic
criticisms as adequate to our modern needs.
Much water has flowed under the bridge since
the days when Ruskin wrote, and his peculiar
temperament, while appreciating much that was
beautiful and worthy to be appreciated, was at
the same time blind to much that is beautiful
and worthy to be appreciated. Ruskin's criticism
on the painting of Whistler would not be
substantiated by a single writer of to-day. At
the same time, all Ruskin's philosophy of art&mdash;that
is to say, æsthetics&mdash;is as true now as it ever
was. Ruskin showed, as the experience of life
and art has shown and always will show&mdash;show
more poignantly and particularly in the case of
Oscar Wilde than in any other&mdash;that art and
morality cannot be divorced, and that if all art
is immoral, then art ceases to exist. "I press
to the conclusion," he said, at the end of his
famous lecture on the relation of art to morals,
"which I wish to leave with you, that all you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
can rightly do, or honourably become, depends
on the government of these two instincts of order
and kindness, by this great imaginative faculty,
which give you inheritance of the past, grasp of
the present, authority over the future. Map out
the spaces of your possible lives by its help;
measure the range of their possible agency! On
the walls and towers of this your fair city, there
is not an ornament of which the first origin may
not be traced back to the thoughts of men who
died two thousand years ago. Whom will <i>you</i>
be governing by your thoughts, two thousand
years hence? Think of it, and you will find that
so far from art being immoral, little else except
art is moral; that life without industry is guilt,
and industry without art is brutality: and for the
words 'good' and 'wicked,' used of men, you
may almost substitute the words 'makers' and
'destroyers.' Far the greater part of the seeming
prosperity of the world is, so far as our present
knowledge extends, vain: wholly useless for any
kind of good, but having assigned to it a certain
inevitable sequence of destruction and of sorrow.
Its stress is only the stress of wandering storm;
its beauty the hectic of plague: and what is
called the history of mankind is too often the
record of the whirlwind, and the map of the
spreading of the leprosy. But underneath all
that, or in narrow spaces of dominion in the
midst of it, the work of every man, <i>qui non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
accepit in vanitatem animan suam</i>, endures and
prospers; a small remnant or green bud of it
prevailing at last over evil. And though faint
with sickness, and encumbered in ruin, the true
workers redeem inch by inch the wilderness into
garden ground; by the help of their joined hands
the order of all things is surely sustained and
vitally expanded, and although with strange
vacillation, in the eyes of the watcher, the
morning cometh, and also the night, there is no
hour of human existence that does not draw on
towards the perfect day."</p>

<p>For our own part let us examine a little into
the relation between art and morality for ourselves.</p>

<p>When we hear it asserted that morality has
nothing to do with art and that moral considerations
are quite beside the mark in æsthetic
criticism and judgment, such a statement is
simply equivalent to saying that actual life has
nothing to do with art. The main demand that
we can make from art of all kinds is the demand
of truth. Truth is beauty, and beauty is truth.
By truth in this connection we mean that higher
and more ideal truth which is inherent in the
realities of things and contained by them, but
which is brought out, explained, made credible,
and visible by the artist in this or that sphere of
art, and through the process of his art purified
from the accidental obscurities which cloud it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
and hide it in the realm of actual life. If we are
to demand truth from the artist, and let us always
remember, as Keats realised so strongly, that in
demanding truth we demand beauty also, we
must insist that the artist must give us nothing
in which a false psychology obtains, must, for
example, paint no passions that do not occur
in actual life. It is, therefore, equally necessary,
on a logical conclusion, that when the subject of
a work of art requires it, the moral should be
represented as it really is&mdash;that is, according to
its truth&mdash;and that the moral law should not
be misrepresented. If we require of the artist
that he should give a vivid representation of
the illusions of human life, of the struggles and
rivalries of men for objects and ends of imaginary
value, we must equally demand of the artist that
he should know and be capable of describing that
which alone has true and absolute value in human
life. Surely it is a truism that every drama from
beginning to end contains a moral. It is a lie
that art is immoral or can by its very nature ever
be so. To say so, to pretend that art has a
separate existence, is to say something which
even the most brilliant paradox cannot prove
and which immediately suggests to the mind
of the thinking man an apologia or reason for
licence of personal conduct. As a great German
writer on æsthetics and the relation to the ethics
has said, all human actions do of necessity presuppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
a norm, a rule to which they conform, or
from which they depart; and there is nothing
which can be represented, whether as criminal or
as ridiculous, or as an object of irony, otherwise
than under this assumption. Hence every artist
enforces some kind of morality, and morality
accordingly becomes of chief moment for æsthetic
judgment.</p>

<p>Aristotle himself, from whom Oscar Wilde
frequently quotes, and incidentally from whose
poetics he attempts, by means of brilliant paradox,
to infer an attitude which is not really there,
has pointed out that art is a means of purification.
If the morality of a work of art is false and
wrong, if the artist is either ignorant of the
subject with which he deals or deliberately misrepresents
the morality of it, then his work is
viewed merely as a work of art&mdash;and therefore
as a thing whole and complete in itself&mdash;is a
failure in art. In many respects it may have
æsthetic excellence, but as a complete thing, as
a work of art, it must inevitably fail.</p>

<p>Sibbern in his "Æsthetik" tells us very sanely
and wisely that art need not be limited by choice
of subject, but depends for its artistic qualities
upon the attitude of the artist in dealing with it.</p>

<p>That art must not be limited by choice of
subject is a great point of Oscar Wilde's own
philosophy, and here he is perfectly sound. But
he goes further in his paradoxical view, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
shows that the artist must hold no brief for
either good or evil, and that the excellence of a
work of art depends entirely upon the skill of
presentation.</p>

<p>The German student, on the contrary, writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There are dramas in which the moral element
is not brought into special prominence, but
just hovers above the surface, and which yet have
their poetic value. What must, however, be
absolutely insisted on is, that the artistic treatment
should never insult morality. We do not
mean that art must not represent the immoral as
well as the moral, for this is, on the contrary,
indispensable, if art is truly to reflect life as it is.
But immorality must not infect and be inherent
in that view of life and those opinions which the
poet desires by his work to promulgate; for then
he would injure morality, and violate that moral
ideal to which all human life, and therefore art
itself, must be subordinated. Plays and novels
which depict virtue as that mere conventionality
and Philistinism which is but an object of
ridicule, or which hold up to our admiration false
and antinomian ideals of virtue, representing <i>e.g.</i>,
the sentimentality of a so-called good heart as
sufficient to justify the most scandalous moral
delinquencies or 'free genius' as privileged to
sin, which paint vice in attractive and seductive
colours, portraying adultery and other transgressions
as very pardonable, and, under certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
circumstances, amiable weaknesses, and which
by means of such delineations bestow absolution
on the public for sins daily occurring in actual
life&mdash;such plays and novels are unworthy of art,
and are as poison to the whole community.</p>

<p>"Equally with all untruth must all impurity
be excluded from art. Purity and chastity are
requirements resulting from the very nature of
art. But it is just because art is so closely
connected with sensuousness, that there is such
obvious temptation to present the sensuous in
false independence, to call forth the mere gratification
of the senses. The sensuous must, however,
be always subordinated to the intellectual,
for this is involved in the demand for <i>ideality</i>,
in other words, for that impress of perfection
given by the idea and the mind in every artistic
representation. And even if æsthetic ideality is
present in a work of art, it must be subordinated
to ethic ideality, to the moral purity in the
artist's mind, a purity diffused throughout the
whole."</p></blockquote>

<p>Enough has been said and quoted to prove to
all those who believe that art, while it is the chief
regenerative force in life, cannot possibly be dissociated
from morals, that Wilde's view of art in
its relation to morals is entirely unsound and
dangerous to the half-educated and those who
do not know how the greatest brains of the world
have regarded this question. It is not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
to continue or to pile proof upon proof, easy
though this would be.</p>

<p>From the people who have a little culture,
imagine they have much more, and are dazzled
by the splendour and beauty of Wilde's execution,
it will be idle to expect an assent. Those
who believe in art for art's sake as an infallible
doctrine, may be divided into three classes.</p>

<p>First of all there are the very young, whose
experience of life has not taught them the truth.
They have not seen or known life as a whole,
and, therefore, no sound ethical view can possibly
disabuse them of the heresy.</p>

<p>There are those again, older and more mature,
who have not made experience of life in its
harsher and sadder aspects sufficient to wean
them from Wilde's theory, in which they are
interested from a purely academic point of view.
And there is another class who are convinced
secretly in their own hearts that art for art's
sake is an untenable doctrine, but know that if
they accepted it they would have to give up
much which they are unable to do without and
which makes life pleasant and dulls the conscience.</p>

<p>It is more satisfactory to turn to the consideration
of "Intentions," and pay an enthusiastic
and reverential meed of praise to this perfection
of art. Marred here and there perhaps by over-elaboration
and ornament, the book nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
remains a masterpiece. In its highest expression,
where paradox and point of view were not insisted
on, where pure lyric narrative fills the page, I
know of nothing more lovely. "Lovely" may
be an exaggerated word, yet I think that it is
almost the only word which can be applied in
this connection. Let me give, as an example, a
few lines from the marvellous and inspired pages
which treat of the Divine Comedy of Dante.
Would that I could quote the whole of the
supreme and splendid passages! That is impossible.
But listen at least to these few lines.</p>

<p>The poet is describing his spiritual experiences
while reading the mighty harmonies of the
Florentine:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On and on we go climbing the marvellous
stair, and the stars become larger than their
wont, and the song of the kings grows faint, and
at length we reach the seven trees of gold and
the garden of the Earthly Paradise. In a
griffin-drawn chariot appears one whose brows
are bound with olive, who is veiled in white,
and mantled in green, and robed in a vesture
that is coloured like live fire. The ancient
flame wakes within us. Our blood quickens
through terrible pulses. We recognise her. It
is Beatrice, the woman we have worshipped.
The ice congealed about our heart melts. Wild
tears of anguish break from us, and we bow our
forehead to the ground, for we know that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
have sinned. When we have done penance, and
are purified, and have drunk of the fountain of
Lethe and bathed in the fountain of Eunoe, the
mistress of our soul raises us to the Paradise of
Heaven. Out of that eternal pearl, the moon,
the face of Piccarda Donati leans to us. Her
beauty troubles us for a moment, and when, like
a thing that falls through water, she passes away,
we gaze after her with wistful eyes."</p></blockquote>

<p>Do not these words strike almost the highest,
purest, and most beautiful note that any writer
of prose has struck throughout the centuries.
In English, at least, I know of nothing more
rapt and ecstatic. It is above criticism and the
man who wrote it must for ever wear in our
minds one of the supreme laurels that artistic
achievement can bestow.</p>

<p>One more paragraph will show the author of
"Intentions" in a different mood, but yet one
in which the supreme sense of beauty and of
form throbs out upon the page and fills our
pulses with that divine and awestruck excitement
that great art can give.</p>

<blockquote><p>"... wake from his forgotten tomb the sweet
Syrian, Meleager, and bid the lover of Heliodore
make you music, for he too has flowers in his
song, red pomegranate-blossoms, and irises that
smell of myrrh, ringed daffodils and dark blue
hyacinths, and marjoram and crinkled ox-eyes.
Dear to him was the perfume of the beanfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
at evening, and dear to him the odorous eared-spikenard
that grew on the Syrian hills, and the
fresh green thyme, the winecup's charm. The
feet of his love as she walked in the garden were
like lilies set upon lilies. Softer than sleep-laden
poppy petals were her lips, softer than violets
and as scented. The flame-light crocus sprang
from the grass to look at her. For her the slim
narcissus stored the cool rain; and for her the
anemones forgot the Sicilian winds that wooed
them. And neither crocus, nor anemone, nor
narcissus was as fair as she was."</p></blockquote>

<p>If the song of Meleager was sweet and if the
suns of summer greet the mountain grave of
Helikê, and the shepherds still repeat their
legends where breaks the blue Sicilian sea by
which Theocritus tuned his lyre; if the voice of
Dante yet rings and sounds in the world-weary
ears of mortals of to-day; if "As You Like It"
has still its appeal to our modern ears as from a
woodland full of flutes, then, indeed, this prose
of Oscar Wilde's, so beautiful and so august,
will remain with us always as an imperishable
treasure of literature and as a lyric in our
hearts.</p>

<p>"Poems in Prose" that Oscar Wilde wrote
were published first in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>,
during July, 1894, when Mr Frank Harris was
the editor. We must remember the date because
it was only a few months before the absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
downfall of the author.</p>

<p>In criticising this work of Wilde's, we cannot
help the reflection that it was written at a
time when enormous, sudden, and overwhelming
success had thrown him entirely from his
mental balance, and had filled him with an even
greater egoism than he ordinarily had, at the time
these fables, or allegories, let us call them, were
produced, Oscar Wilde was at the very height
of his success, and of his almost insane irresponsibility
also.</p>

<p>That they are beautiful it would be idle to
deny. Still we have the sure and dexterous pen
employed upon them. There is no faltering in
phrase, no hesitation of artistry. It is said by
many people who heard the poet recite these
stories upon social occasions, tell them to please,
amuse, or bewilder one of those gatherings in
which he was the centre in a constellation, that,
spoken, they were far more beautiful than when
at length he wrote them down and published
them in the review. I can well believe it. On
the two occasions when I myself heard Oscar
Wilde talking, I realised how unprecedented his
talent for conversation was, and wished that I
also could hear him at times when he attempted
his highest flights. Yet, even as pieces of prose,
the title the author chose for them is perfectly
justified. They are indeed "poems" in prose
and triumphant examples of technical accomplishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and mastery.</p>

<p>Yet, the condemnation of their teaching can
hardly be too severe. With every wish in the
world to realise that a paradox is only a truth
standing on its head to attract attention, with
every desire to give the author his due, no honest
man, no Christian, no Catholic, no Protestant, but
must turn from these few paragraphs of allegory
with sorrow and a sense of something very like
shame.</p>

<p>And it is for this reason.</p>

<p>The poet has dared an attempt of invasion
into places where neither he nor any artist has
right. With an insane pride he dares to patronise,
to limit and to explain the Almighty.</p>

<p>Nowhere in this Appreciation have I made a
whole-hearted condemnation of anything Wilde
has written. Even at times when I most disagreed
with his attitude I have attempted, I hope
with humility and sincerity, to present the other
side of the shield. Here I do not see there is
anything to be said in favour of at least two or
three of the prose poems&mdash;those two or three
which give colour to the whole.</p>

<p>There is one of them called "The Doer of
Good." It begins in this wise:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"It was night time and He was alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And He saw afar off the walls of a round city and went towards the city."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our Lord is meant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>The allegory goes on to say that when Christ
came near to the city He heard music and
the sounds of happiness and joy. He knocked
at the gate and "certain of the gatekeepers
opened to Him."</p>

<p>Our Lord passes through the beautiful halls
of a palace and sees upon a "couch of sea purple"
a man bearing all the signs of an ancient Greek
stupefied by pleasure and by wine. The Protagonist
asks the man He sees&mdash;"Why do you
live like this?"</p>

<p>Then Wilde's prose goes on to tell how the
young man turns and recognises his interlocutor
and answers that he was a leper once, that Christ
had healed him. How else should he live?</p>

<p>Our Lord leaves the palace and walks through
the city, and he sees another young man pursuing
a harlot, while his eyes are bright with lust.
He speaks to the young man and asks him the
reason of his way of life, and the young man
turns and tells the Saviour of Mankind that he
was once blind and that He had given him sight,
and, therefore, at what else could he look?</p>

<p>The allegory goes on, but it is not necessary
to continue an account of it. All it is necessary
and right to say is, that the allegory is blasphemous
and horrible&mdash;horrible with the insane
pride of one who has not realised his imminent
fall, who has realised the horror of his mental
attitude no less than the life he was proved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
have been leading at the time.</p>

<p>I have purposely refrained from quotation here.
But let it again be said that the artistic presentment
of these parables is without flaw.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be a kindness to the
memory of Oscar Wilde, nor be doing a service
to anyone at all, to continue this ethical criticism
of the "Poems in Prose." Let me say only
that Wilde, in another story, takes a sinner
to the Judgment Seat and introduces God the
Father into a dialogue in which the sinner
silences the Almighty by his repartee. All
these "Poems in Prose" are written beautifully,
as I have said, but also with an extraordinarily
adroit use of actual phrases from the New Testament.
I will permit myself one quotation
before I conclude, which is surely saddening in
its significance in the view of after events.</p>

<p>And God said to the Man: "Thy life hath
been Evil, and the Beauty I have shown thou
hast sought for, and the Good I have hidden
thou did'st pass by."</p>

<p>It remains to say something about Wilde's
final essay, entitled "The Soul of Man," which
also appeared in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>. Upon
its appearance it was called "The Soul of Man
under Socialism," but it has since been republished
under the title of "The Soul of
Man."</p>

<p>This essay, brilliant in conception, brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
in execution, has none of the old lyric beauty
of phrase. It can in no sense be considered a
masterpiece of prose, but only a piece of fine
and cultured writing. In it paradox obscures
the underlying truth. The very first words
strike the old weary note. "The chief advantage
that would result from the establishment
of Socialism is, undoubtedly, the fact
that Socialism would relieve us from that sordid
necessity of living for others, which, in the
present condition of things, presses so hardly
upon himself and everybody."</p>

<p>As far as the prose artist is concerned, the
essay has little to recommend it. He was tired,
tired out, and had no longer the wish or the
stimulus to produce the marvellous and glowing
prose to which we have been accustomed in
these other statements of the writer's attitude
towards art, towards morals and towards beauty.
Yet, at the same time, the man's love of individualism
drove him to write this essay, and
at certain points it comes strangely into impact
with Catholic truth.</p>

<p>The more Catholic the conception of religion
and of art becomes, the more surely the socialistic
idea obtains. Certainly our Lord taught that
individual character can only be developed
through community. The great socialistic organ
of England attempted the value and weight of
Oscar Wilde's defence of Socialism in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Christ taught that individual character could
only be developed through community. Some
say he opposed Socialism because, when two
young capitalists came to him wrangling about
their private property, he ignored them, saying,
'Who made me a divider among you?' I
suppose these objectors still think that Socialism
means dividing up. When his enemies were
closing in upon him, and his life hung in the
balance, a woman came and anointed his feet,
and wiped them with her hair, and the good
people were shocked, and complained of the
waste. Might not the ointment have been sold,
and the money doled out to the poor? Christ
defended her generous impulse, and remarked:
'The poor you have always with you. You
have plenty of opportunities of helping them.
Me you have not always.' This is erected into
a great pronouncement that we must not
attempt to abolish poverty! To such amusing
shifts are Christian Individualists driven!</p>

<p>"But our contention is that although Christ
was not a State Socialist, his spirit, embodied in
the Christian Church, inevitably urges men to
Socialism; that the political development of the
Catholic Faith is along the lines of Socialism;
and that, as the State captured the Church in
the past, so now it is the business of the Church
to recapture the State, and through it to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
God's Kingdom on earth."</p></blockquote>

<p>I quote them here in order to show what
sympathy the essay awakened, even though that
sympathy is utterly alien to the belief of the
chronicler. And now let us finally bid farewell
to Oscar Wilde as Æsthete, or, rather, as prophet
and expounder of the æsthetic.</p>

<p>I have placed on record not only my own
small opinion of his teachings, but a very solid
and weighty consensus of condemnation of his
attitude.</p>

<p>And I hope, from the purely literary point of
view, I have made obeisance and given every
credit to one of the greatest literary artists of
our time.</p>

<h2>"DE PROFUNDIS"</h2>


<blockquote><p>"I Have entered on a performance which is
without example, whose accomplishments will
have no imitator. I mean to present my fellow-mortals
with a man in all the integrity of nature;
and this man shall be myself.</p>

<p>"I know my heart, and have studied mankind;
I am not made like anyone I have been acquainted
with, perhaps like no one in existence;
if not better, I at least claim originality, and
whether Nature did wisely in breaking the
mould with which she formed me, can only be
determined after having read this work.</p>

<p>"Whenever the last trumpet shall sound, I
will present myself before the sovereign Judge
with this book in my hand, and loudly proclaim,
Thus have I acted; these were my thoughts;
such was I. With equal freedom and veracity
have I related what was laudable or wicked, I
have concealed no crimes, added no virtues; and
if I have sometimes introduced superfluous
ornament, it was merely to occupy a void
occasioned by defect of memory. I may have
supposed that certain, which I only knew to
be probable, but have never asserted as truth
a conscious falsehood. Such as I was, I have
declared myself; sometimes vile and despicable,
at others, virtuous, generous, and sublime. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
as thou hast read my inmost soul, Power eternal!

let them blush at my depravity, let
them tremble at my sufferings; let each in his
turn expose with equal sincerity the failings, the
wanderings of his heart, and, if he dare, aver,
<i>I was better than that man</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the first words in that book which
it was supposed would always stand as a type of
real self-revelation and confession and which now
is thought of by all the world as merely a
brilliant piece of literature and an amazing tissue
of misrepresentations.</p>

<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau never gave his real self
to the world despite the loud Gallic boast of the
paragraphs above.</p>

<p>Did De Quincey? Did St Augustine? Did
anyone ever tell the truth about himself from
the very beginnings of literature? Newman's
"Apologia"; Bunyan's "Grace Abounding"; the
Journals of Wesley; the Memoirs of Madame
de Stael de Launay; the diary of Madame
D'Arblay; the "Ausmeinem Leben" of Goethe,
the "Lavengro" of Borrow&mdash;how much in all
these and in the hundred other works of like
nature which crowd to the mind, how much is
self-deception, how much picturesque fiction?</p>

<p>Who can say?</p>

<p>There is only one way of determining the value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
of an autobiographical statement&mdash;by a comparison
of internal evidence with external historic
fact. In the case of people whose generation
has passed away this task is beset with difficulties,
though not impossible. In the case of
one who has but recently died, whose friends
and contemporaries are living still, about whom
documentary and oral evidence abounds, the task
is more easy, though still a hard and, possibly, a
thankless one.</p>

<p>In a consideration and criticism, however, of
Oscar Wilde's greatest work, "De Profundis,"
such an attempt must undoubtedly be made.</p>

<p>Yet, this question of sincerity or reality is not
the only one to be determined, and it will be
well, therefore, to treat of "De Profundis" with
the assistance of a definite plan of criticism.</p>

<p>Let us then divide this part of the book into
several sections.</p>

<p>There are, undoubtedly, a great many people
who have heard the name of the book and read
the extraordinarily copious reviews of it in the
public press, but have no further acquaintance
with it than just that. It will be necessary,
therefore, in the first instance, to give an account
of the actual subject-matter in order to make
the following criticism intelligible and, it is to
be hoped, to induce them to purchase and
read this marvellous monograph, which is one
of the world's minor masterpieces, for themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, a purely literary criticism will not
be out of place, a criticism which treats of the
book as a consummate work of art and a piece
of prose almost unparalleled for its splendour
and beauty in modern literature.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the vexed question of its conscious or
unconscious sincerity must be dealt with, while
the fourth consideration should surely be devoted
to the philosophy and teaching, especially in its
regard to the Christian Faith, which is definitely
promulgated within the book.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words about its actual legacy to
the Europe of to-day should conclude this part
of the Appreciation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"De Profundis" was published by Messrs
Methuen &amp; Company on 23rd February 1905.
It was written by Oscar Wilde when in prison,
by special permission of the Home Secretary.
A fuller account of these details will be found
in Part I. of this book.</p>

<p>Directly "De Profundis" made its appearance
the whole press of England, almost without exception,
devoted a large space to its consideration.
The sensation the book occasioned was
extraordinary and almost without parallel in
modern times. An enormous controversy arose
about it immediately. Every possible aspect of
the book was canvassed and discussed, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
strange as it may seem, a vast amount of venom
and bitterness was mingled with the bulk of
eulogy. The student of contemporary literature,
or perhaps, in view of what I am going to say, it
would be better to call it contemporary book
publishing, can find no parallel to the interest
and excitement this book occasioned, save only
in the case of a very different production called
"When it was Dark," an over-rated sensational
novel by a Mr "Guy Thorne," whose views
excited the various religious parties in the Church
of England to a sort of frenzy for and against
them.</p>

<p>In pure literature I know of nothing which,
upon its appearance, made such an immediate
stir as "De Profundis."</p>

<p>With the various views of various sections of
the community, I propose to deal later. With
the doubts that were thrown on its authenticity
as a genuine prison manuscript I have already
dealt. I may here, however, quote a few words
of a statement made by the editor of "De Profundis,"
Mr Robert Ross, to a representative of
an evening paper. They will explain for the
reader all that he will further find necessary to
introduce him to the circumstances under which
"De Profundis" appeared.</p>

<p>"My object," he said, "in publishing this
book, as I have indicated in the preface and in
my letter to <i>The St James's Gazette</i>, was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Mr Oscar Wilde might come to be regarded as a
factor in English literature along with his distinguished
contemporaries. The success of 'De
Profundis' and the reviews lead me to believe
that my object has been achieved.</p>

<p>"I cannot expect the world to share my
admiration of Mr Oscar Wilde as a man of
letters, at present, although that admiration is
already shared by many distinguished men of
letters in England, by the whole of Germany,
and by a considerable portion of the literary
class in France.</p>

<p>"With regard to the authenticity of the
manuscript, I may say that it was well known
that during his incarceration at Reading Gaol he
was granted the privileges of pen and paper, only
permitted in exceptional cases, at the instance of
influential people not his personal friends. The
manuscript of 'De Profundis,' about which he
wrote to me very often during the last months
of his imprisonment, was handed to me on the
day of his release. The letters he had written
to me in reference to it are published in the
German edition of the work, and later on,
perhaps, they may appear in England, if I think
it desirable to publish them here.</p>

<p>"Contrary to general belief the manuscript
contains nothing of a scandalous nature, and if
there was another object in publishing the work
it was to remove that false impression which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
had gained ground. The portions which I have
omitted in the English publication, apart from
the letters to which I have already referred as
appearing in the German edition, are all of a
private character. There are one or two unimportant
passages which the English publisher&mdash;very
wisely, I think&mdash;deemed unsuitable for immediate
reproduction in England.</p>

<p>"In Germany Mr Oscar Wilde's place in
English literature had already been accepted.
'Salomé,' for instance, is now part of the repertoire,
and Strauss, the great musician, is engaged
on an opera based on Mr Wilde's work, which
he selected out of many others because of its
popularity in Germany, and also, no doubt, on
account of the dramatic intensity of Mr Wilde's
interpretation of the Biblical story.</p>

<p>"It is not for me to criticise or to appreciate
'De Profundis' on which many competent
writers have given their opinions, but I should
have imagined that it was sufficiently clear that
Mr Oscar Wilde had not attempted to throw
any blame for his misfortune on anyone but
himself.</p>

<p>"The manuscript is written on blue prison
foolscap. There are a few corrections. Although
Mr Wilde gave me very full instructions with
regard to those portions which he wished published
he allowed me absolute discretion in the
matter, which he did about all his other manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
and letters."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Subject-Matter of "De Profundis"</span></h3>

<p>I have said that for those who have not read
the book, a short synopsis of its contents is
necessary here. But I am immediately confronted
with a difficulty because, probably, no
book is more difficult to sum up, to make a
<i>précis</i> from, than this. However, I do all that
is possible, and only ask my readers to remember
that this bald catalogue will be elucidated further
on in the article. In the preface to the book a
letter of Oscar Wilde to the editor is quoted in
which he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I don't defend my conduct. I explain it.
Also there is in my letter certain passages which
deal with my mental development in prison, and
the inevitable evolution of my character and intellectual
attitude towards life that has taken
place; and I want you and others who still stand
by me and have affection for me to know
exactly in what mood and manner I hope to
face the world. Of course, from one point of
view, I know that on the day of my release I
shall be merely passing from one prison into
another.... Prison life makes one see people
and things as they really are. That is why it
turns one to stone.... I have 'cleansed my
bosom of much perilous stuff.' I need not remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
you that mere expression is to an artist the
supreme and only mode of life.... For nearly
two years I have had within a growing burden
of bitterness, of much of which I have now got
rid."</p></blockquote>

<p>This, in some sort of way, will give the reader
an idea of what the book consists or, at anyrate,
of its other view about it.</p>

<p>He begins the work by a statement of the
terrible suffering he is undergoing in prison.
The iron discipline, the paralysing immobility of
a life which is as monotonous and regular as the
movement of a great machine, are set forth
subjectively by a presentment of the effects they
are having upon the prisoner's brain. "It is
always twilight in one's cell, as it is always
twilight in one's heart."</p>

<p>... He is transferred to a new prison. Three
months elapse, and he is told of his mother's
death. He speaks of his deep love and veneration
for her and says that he who was once a
"lord of language" has now no words left in
which to tell of the appalling shame which has
seized upon his heart and mind. He realises the
infamy with which he has covered that honoured
name.</p>

<p>An anecdote comes into these sorrowful pages.
It is an anecdote of his sad and guarded appearance
among the world of men when he was
brought to appear before the Court of Bankruptcy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
As he walked manacled in the corridor towards
the Court Room, a friend of his, who was waiting,
lifted his hat and bowed. Waited, "that, before
the whole crowd, whom such an action so sweet
and simple hushed into silence, he might raise
his hat to me, as, handcuffed and with bowed
head, I passed him by."</p>

<p>A page or two is occupied with the poor
convict's gratitude for this simple, sweet and
dignified action. A marvellous eulogy is pronounced
upon it.</p>

<p>What prison means to a man in the upper
ranks of life is set forth in words of anguish, and
then, following these paragraphs, is a frank
admission that Wilde had ruined himself. "I
am quite ready to say so. I am trying to say
so, though they may not think it at the present
moment. This pitiless indictment I bring without
pity against myself."</p>

<p>He describes the great and brilliant position
he had held in the world. He tells of all the
splendid things with which fortune had endowed
him. He admits that he allowed pleasure to
dominate him and that his end came with
irremediable disgrace.</p>

<p>He has lain in prison for nearly two years, and
now he begins to describe his mental development
during the long torture. Humility, he
says, is what he has found, like a treasure in a
field. From this newly discovered treasure he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
builds up a method of conduct which he will
pursue when he is released from durance. He
knows, indeed, that kind friends will await him
on the other side of the prison door. He will
not have to beg his bread, but, nevertheless,
humility shall bloom like a flower in his heart.</p>

<p>He begins to speak of religion, and avows his
atheism. "The faith that others give to what is
unseen, I give to what one can touch, and look
at." There is no help for him in religion.</p>

<p>He goes on to speak of reason. There is no
help for him in reason. Reason tells him that
the laws under which he was convicted were
wrong and unjust laws, the system under which
he suffered a wrong and unjust system.</p>

<p>Yet, in pursuance of his determination of
Humility, he resolves to make all that has happened
to him into a spiritualising medium. He
is going to weave his pain and agony into the
warp and woof of his life with the same readiness
with which he wove the time of pleasure and
success into the completion of his temperament.</p>

<p>Then there comes a long discussion of his own
position at the moment, a common prisoner in
a common gaol, and of what his position will be
afterwards. He tells of occasions on which he
was allowed to see his friends in prison, and
afterwards describes a moment of his deepest
degradation, when he was jeered at in convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
dress as he stood, one of a chained gang, on
Clapham Junction platform. The story is utterly
terrible. On the occasion of his removal
from London to Reading, he says, "I had to
stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction
in convict dress and handcuffed, for all the
world to look at.... When people saw me
they laughed. Each train as it came up swelled
the audience. Nothing could exceed their
amusement. That was, of course, before they
knew who I was. As soon as they had been
informed they laughed still more. For half-an-hour
I stood there, in the grey November rain,
surrounded by a jeering mob."</p>

<p>We find now, in our short survey of the book,
the widely discussed passages about the personality
and message of Christ. These form the
greater part of this strange and moving masterpiece.
They will be treated of hereafter.</p>

<p>Finally, come anticipations of release and plans
for the future, and "De Profundis" concludes
with an especially poignant and almost painfully
beautiful passage which anticipates the kindliness
of Nature to heal a bruised soul to which
man has given no solace:</p>

<p>"But Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust
and just alike, will have clefts in the rocks
where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose
silence I may weep undisturbed. She will hang
the night with stars so that I may walk abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
in the darkness without stumbling, and send the
wind over my footprints so that none may track
me to my hurt; she will cleanse me in great
waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"De Profundis" as a Piece of Prose</span></h3>

<p>There is very little of the wise and sensuous
geniality of Horace in Oscar Wilde's outlook
upon life. But some lines of the poet, never a
great favourite with Wilde by the way, certainly
have a direct application upon the style of the
author of "De Profundis"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2q">"Saepe stilum vertas, iterum quæ digna legi sint<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Scripturus; neque te ut miretur turba labores,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Contentus paucis lectoribus."&mdash;S. I. 10, 72.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A piece of prose to Oscar Wilde was always,
in a sense, like a definite musical composition in
which words took the place of notes, and he
carried out the poet's injunction to polish and
rewrite with meticulous care.</p>

<p>Wilde had, in a marvellously developed degree,
the sense that a piece of prose was a built-up
thing proceeding piece by piece, movement by
movement, sentence by sentence, and word by
word towards a definite and well-understood
effect. "It was the architectural conception
of work which foresees the end in the beginning
and never loses sight of it, and in every part is
conscious of all the rest, till the last sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
does but, with undiminished vigour, unfold and
justify the first."</p>

<p>These lines were written by Oscar Wilde's
master in English prose, Walter Pater, and we
shall see how entirely Wilde has adhered to such
an artistic attitude. Like the Greeks, he believed
in an elaborate criticism of language, and
the metrical movements of prose were scientifically
and artistically interesting to him, as any
student of harmony takes pleasure in a contrapuntal
exercise. The analogy is perfectly correct,
and Wilde himself has drawn attention to it
more than once in his prose writings. Counterpoint
consisted, in the old days of music, when
a system of sounds called points were used for
notation, in two or more lines of these points;
each line represented a melody which, when set
against each other and sounded simultaneously,
produced correct harmony.</p>

<p>Wilde's prose was moulded entirely upon an
appreciation of these facts, and the ear must
always be the critic of the excellence of his prose
rather than the intelligence, in the first instance,
as reached by the eye. If we read aloud passages
of "De Profundis" the full splendour of them
strikes us far more poignantly than in any other
way. It is true that Wilde's prose makes an
appeal <i>ad clerum</i>, and it is not necessary for the
connoisseur, the initiate, to apply the test of the
spoken word. But those who are not actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
conversant with the more technical niceties of
style will do well to read Wilde's prose aloud.
They will discover in it new and unsuspected
beauties.</p>

<p>Wilde, at one period of his career, published
a series of short paragraph stories which he
called "Poems in Prose." With him there were
many points of contact between prose and
poetry. The two things could overlap and
intermingle, though in his hands neither lost
its own individuality in the process. There has
been too much said in the past about the old
principle of sharp division between poetry and
prose. This was a classical tradition and was
one which well applied to the Greek and Latin
languages. It was maintained, until a late era
in our own English literature, by the Gibbons
and Macaulays who moulded themselves upon
Cicero and Livy. But during the last century
the force of the old tradition weakened very
much. A newer and more flexible style of writing
became permissible. Coleridge, De Quincey,
Swift, Lamb, to mention a few names at
random, showed that, at anyrate, prose need
no longer be written as a stately cataract of
ordered words with due balance and antithesis,
and with certain rigid movements which were
thought indispensable to correct writing.</p>

<p>Dr Boswell said, apropos of style&mdash;"Some
think Swift's the best; others prefer a fuller and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
grander way of writing." To whom Dr Johnson
replied&mdash;"Sir, you must first define what you
mean by style, before you can judge who has
good taste in style and who has bad. The two
classes of persons whom you have mentioned
don't differ as to good and bad. They both
agree that Swift has a good neat style, but one
loves a neat style, another a style of more
splendour. In the like manner one loves a
plain coat, another loves a laced coat; but
neither will deny that each is good in its kind."</p>

<p>Although Johnson and his contemporaries
certainly had a great sense of rhythm and harmony
in prose they were the last defenders of
the old axiom that poetry and prose were two
entirely separate things. It was Walter Pater
who, in our own times, finally demolished the
old tradition, and opened the way for a writer,
such as Oscar Wilde, to bring the new discovery
to its fullest perfection. Walter Pater showed
that it was not true that poetry differs only from
prose by the presence of metrical restraint.</p>

<p>Wilde, understanding this, most thoroughly,
resolved early in his literary career that his prose
should be beautifully coloured, jewelled, ornate,
and yet capable of every delicate nuance, every
almost lyric echo that could be caught from the
realms of poesy and welded into the many-coloured
fabric.</p>

<p>In Wilde's "Intentions" we have an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
of his most ornamented and decorated prose, so
marvellously musical that it reminds us of a
fugue played on a mighty organ with innumerable
stops. Yet, at the same time, in this book
of Essays, Oscar Wilde frequently laid himself
open to the charge of precocity and over-elaboration.
It is possible to obscure the grand and
massive lines of a building by an over-elaboration
of detail. Beautiful as decorated Gothic is,
I have in mind the Cathedral of Cologne, there
is a more massive grandeur in the early mediæval
work than anything the later style can give.</p>

<p>"De Profundis" is purged of all the faults&mdash;one
might almost say the faults of excellence&mdash;that
the hypercritical student may sometimes
find in the earlier prose of its author. Just as
the man himself was purged and purified in mind
by the terrible experiences of prison, so his style
also became stronger and more beautiful, and
what was once reminiscent of a marvellous
nocturne or ballade of Chopin, or "some mad
scarlet thing by Dvorak" inherent with all the
beauty of just this, now acquires the harmony
and strength of a great wind blowing through a
forest.</p>

<p>The prose is still full of the old symbolism and
imagery, but these two means of producing an
effect are used with much more restraint of
language and simplicity of words. Note, for
example, how the following paragraph, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
when read aloud, proceeds from symbol to
symbol with a marvellously adroit use of the
dactyl and the spondæ, or rather their equivalents
in English prosody, until the final thought
is enunciated, the voice drops, the sentence is
complete. "When one has weighed the sun in
the balance and measured the steps of the moon,
and mapped out the seven Heavens, star by
star, there still remains oneself."</p>

<p>Here we notice in addition, the extraordinary
influence that the words of the Bible always had
upon the prose of Oscar Wilde. In his lonely
prison cell, where nearly the whole of his reading
must have consisted of Holy Scripture, the influence
was naturally greater than ever before.
No one can read "De Profundis" with its
rhythmic repetitions of phrase without realising
this in an extraordinary degree. Take the
passage I have just quoted and the following
paragraph, which, let me assure my readers, I
have taken quite at random, opening a Bible
and turning over but a very few leaves of the
Old Testament without any regular search,&mdash;"So
that they shall take no wood out of the
field, neither cut down out of the forest; for
they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they
shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those
that robbed them, saith the Lord God."</p>

<p>Yes! there can be no possible doubt that
much of the inspiration of "De Profundis"&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
is, the purely literary inspiration&mdash;came
from the solemn harmonies and balanced
phrases of the old Hebrew singers and poets.</p>

<p>With Job, Oscar Wilde might well have said,
and his own lamentations are strangely reminiscent
of the phrase, "My harp is turned
to mourning and my organ into the voice of
them that weep."</p>

<p>In "De Profundis" the special passages of
rare and melodious beauty which star the printed
page at no long intervals, have been very
widely commented upon and quoted. By this
time they are quite familiar to all who take an
interest in modern literature, and this masterpiece
of it in particular. Yet, in considering the
prose of "De Profundis" we must not forget to
pay a due meed of praise to the great substance
of the book in which an extraordinary ease and
dignity of style, an absolute simplicity of effect,
which conceals the most elaborate art and the
most profound knowledge of the science of
words, links together those more memorable,
because more striking, passages which leap out
from the page and plant themselves in the mind
of the appreciative reader like arrows.</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is hardly a word in 'De Profundis'
misplaced, misused, or used at all unless the
fullest possible value is got from its presence in
the sentence. Even now and then, when, in the
midst of the grave rhetoric of his psychology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the author descends into colloquialism, the ear is
not offended in the least. He knows the precise
moment when the little homely word will bring
back to the reader the fact that he is reading a
human document written by a human sufferer
in a prison cell.</p>

<p>"If, after I am free, a friend of mine gave a
feast, and did not invite me to it, I should
not mind a bit, I can be perfectly happy by
myself."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here in the midst of passages of calculated
and cadenced beauty we have a little carefully
devised sentence to which, though the
ordinary reader will not realise the art and
cunning of its employment, it will have precisely
the effect upon the brain of the ordinary
reader that Oscar Wilde designed when he
wrote it.</p>

<p>The literary man himself, accustomed to deal
with words, can, and will, appreciate the art of
the artist in this regard.</p>

<p>It is with the profoundest appreciation and
admiration for the marvellous skill of presentation,
the perfect power and flexibility of the
prose that I leave the consideration of the purely
artistic merits of the book and turn to its real
value as a human document.</p>

<p>As Oscar Wilde said of himself, he was indeed
a "lord of language."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"De Profundis" as a Revelation of Self</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></h3>

<p>We now come to a consideration of "De Profundis"
as a revelation, or not, of the real sentiments
and thoughts of the man who wrote it.</p>

<p>To the British temperament it is always far
more important, in the judgment of a book, that
the writer should be sincere in the writing than
that what he wrote should be perfectly artistic.</p>

<p>The British public, indeed, the whole Anglo-Saxon
world, has never been able to adapt itself
to the French attitude that, provided a thing is
a flawless work of art, the sincerity of the writer
has nothing whatever to do with its worth. This
attitude Wilde himself consistently preached in
season and out of season. For example, he
wrote a study of Wainwright, the poisoner,
which, read from the ordinary English ethical
point of view, would seem to show him a most
sympathetic advocate of crime, provided only
the criminal committed his crimes in an artistic
manner and had also a sense of art in life.</p>

<p>When a friend reproached the monster Wainwright
with the murder of an innocent girl,
Helen Abercrombie, to whom he owed every
duty of kindness and protection, he shrugged his
shoulders and said&mdash;"Yes, it was a dreadful
thing to do, but she had very thick ankles." If
we are to take Oscar Wilde's essay, "Pen,
Pencil and Poison," quite seriously we must
believe him to be utterly indifferent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
monstrous moral character of the hero of his
memoir. He speaks of him as being not merely
a poet and a painter, an art critic and antiquarian,
a writer of prose and a dilettante of things
delightful, but also a forger of no mean nor
ordinary capacities, and as a subtle and secret
poisoner almost without rival in this or any age.</p>

<p>When "De Profundis" first made its appearance
and the flood of criticism began, dozens of
critics pounced upon the book, admitted its
marvellous literary charm and achievement, and
said that its author was absolutely and utterly
insincere in all he wrote about himself. <i>The
Times</i> for example, which still holds a certain
pre-eminence of place, although it is the fashion
of a younger generation to decry it and to pretend
that it has lost all its influence, owing both
to the change of public taste in journalistic
requirements and certain business enterprises
which have been associated with its name, spoke
out to this effect with careful and calculated
sincerity.</p>

<p>In an article which was extremely well written
and had indubitably a certain psychological
insight, the leading journal condemned "De
Profundis" from an ethical point of view with
no uncertain voice. It said that, while it was
possessed by every wish to understand the
author and to sympathise with him in the
hideous ruin of his brilliant career, it was impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
except in a very few instances, to regard
his posthumous book as anything but a mere
literary feat.</p>

<p>The excellence of that was granted, but it was
not allowed to be anything more than that.</p>

<p>It was not in this way, so said the writer in
<i>The Times</i>, that souls were laid bare, this was
not sorrow, but the most dextrous counterfeit
of sorrow. Wilde, so the review stated, was
"probably unable to cry from the depths at all."
His book simply showed that there was an
armour of egotism which no arrow of fate was
able to pierce. Even in "De Profundis" the
poseur supplemented the artist, and the truth
was not in him. If the heart of a broken man
showed at all in the book it must, said <i>The
Times</i>, "be looked for between the lines. It
was rarely in them."</p>

<p>In short, so the review, when summed up and
crystallised, implied, Wilde was incapable of
telling the truth about himself, or about anything
at all. Sometimes in his writings he fell
upon the truth by accident, and then his works
contained a modicum of truth. Consciously, he
was never able to discover it, consciously, he was
never able to enunciate it.</p>

<p>Now, that is a point of view which is natural
enough, but which, after careful study, I cannot
substantiate in any way. Over and over again
the same thing was said. Everybody was prepared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
at last, to admit that Wilde was a great
artist&mdash;in direct contradiction to that condemnation
of even his literary power which was poured
upon his works at the time of his downfall&mdash;but
the general opinion of the leading critics seemed
to point to the fact of "De Profundis" being a
pose and insincere.</p>

<p>Now, if the book was merely an excursion in
attitude, a considered work of art without any
very profound relation to the truth of its personal
psychology, then I think the book would be a
less saddening thing than it undoubtedly is.
Surely, the author had a perfect right, if he so
wished, to produce a psychological romance.
This I know is not a generally held opinion, but
I do not see how anybody who knows anything
about the brain of the artist and the ethics of
creation can really deny it. If the work is
absolutely sincere, as I believe it to be, then,
from the moral point of view, it is indeed
a terrible document. It shows us how little
the extraordinary, complex temperament of
Oscar Wilde was really chastened and purified.
It provides us with a moral picture of monstrous
egotism set in a frame of jewels.</p>

<p>As has been said so often before in this book,
the worse and insane side of Oscar Wilde must
always obscure and conquer the better and
beautiful side of him.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde describes himself as a "lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
language." This is perfectly true. He goes on
to say that he "stood in symbolic relations to
the art and culture of his time." This is only
half true. He continues that "I felt it myself
and made others feel it." The first half of this
sentence is too true, the second half is untrue,
inasmuch as it implies that he made everyone
feel it, whereas he mistook the flattery and
adulation of a tiny coterie for the applause and
sanction of a nation. Oscar Wilde always lived
within four very narrow walls. At one time
they were the swaying misty walls conjured up
by a few and not very important voices, at
another they were the walls of concrete and
corrugated iron, the whitewashed walls of his
prison cell. He says that his relations to his
time were more noble, more permanent, of more
vital issue, of larger scope than Byron's relation
to his time. Then, almost in the same breath,
he begins to tell us that there is only one thing
for him now, "absolute humility." That something
hidden away in his nature like a treasure
in a field is "humility."</p>

<p>Comment is almost cruel here.</p>

<p>In another part of "De Profundis" the author
airily and lightly touches upon those horrors
which had ruined him and made him what he
was, and which kept him where he was.</p>

<blockquote><p>"People thought it dreadful of me to have
entertained at dinner the evil things of life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
to have found pleasure in their company. But
then, from the point of view through which I, as
an artist in life, approached them, they were
delightfully suggestive and stimulating. The
danger was half the excitement...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Is this Humility and is this Repentance? To
me it seems as terrible a conviction of madness
and inability to understand the depth to which
he had sunk as one could find in the whole
realm of literature.</p>

<p>"People thought it dreadful of me to have
entertained," etc. etc. Does not the very phrase
suggest that Wilde still thinks in his new-found
"humility" that it was not dreadful of him at
all and that he had a perfect right to do so?</p>

<p>There is no doubt of his absolute sincerity.
He is absolutely incapable of understanding.
He still thinks, lying in torture, that he has done
nothing wrong. He has made an error of
judgment, he has misapprehended his attitude
towards society. He has not sinned. Once
only does he admit, in a single sentence, that
any real culpability attached to him. "I grew
careless of the lives of others." This shows that
a momentary glimpse of the truth had entered
that unhappy brain, but it is carelessly uttered,
and carelessly dismissed. All he cared for, if we
believe this book to be sincere, as I think nobody
who really understands the man and his mental
condition at the time that it was written, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
fail to believe, is, that every fresh sensation at
any cost to himself and others, was his only duty
towards himself and his art.</p>

<p>Doubtless when he wrote "De Profundis"
Oscar Wilde believed absolutely in his own
attitude. He was no Lucifer in his own account,
no fallen angel. He was only a spirit of
light which had made a mistake and found itself
in fetters. That is the tragedy of the book, that
its author could never see himself as others saw
him or realise that he had sinned. When Satan
fell from Heaven, in Milton's mighty work, he
made no attempt to persuade himself that he
had found something hidden away within him
like a treasure in a field&mdash;"Humility." There
was in the imaginary portrait of the Author of
Evil still an awful and impious defiance of the
Forces that controlled all nature and him as a
part of nature.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde could look back upon all he did
to himself and all the incalculable evil he wrought
upon others and say quite calmly that he did not
regret for a single moment having lived for
pleasure. He tells us that he threw the "pearl
of his soul into a cup of wine," that he "went
down the primrose path to the sound of
flutes." And then, after living on honeycomb
he realises that to have continued living on
honeycomb would have been wrong, because
it would have arrested the continuance of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
development.</p>

<p>"I had to pass on."</p>

<p>Let us pass on also to a consideration of Wilde's
teaching on Christianity in "De Profundis."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Author's View of the Christian Faith</span></h3>

<p>It is necessary to deal with this part of "De
Profundis" which treats of the unhappy author's
"discoveries" in Christianity, because his views
were put so perfectly, with such a wealth of
phrase, with such apparent certainty of conviction,
that they may well have an influence upon
young and impressionable minds which will be,
and possibly has been, dangerous and unsettling.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the teaching of
"De Profundis," or rather the point of view
enunciated in it, which deals with Christianity,
shows that Oscar Wilde had failed to gain any
real insight into the Faith. It is quite true that
various of the sects within the English Church,
especially those which dissent from the Establishment,
might find themselves in accordance with
much that Wilde said. A Catholic, however,
cannot for a moment admit that the poet's teachings
are anything but paradoxical, dangerous,
and untrue.</p>

<p>A minister of the Protestant Church, Canon
Beeching, preaching at Westminster Abbey on
"The Sinlessness of Christ," referred to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
portions of "De Profundis," with which I am
dealing now, in no uncertain way.</p>

<p>There are here and there things that a Catholic
would not entirely endorse in Canon Beeching's
sermon, yet, on the whole, it is a very sane and
fair presentation of what a Christian must think
in reading "De Profundis." It is as well to say
frankly, that I write as a Catholic, and, in this
section of my criticism, for those who are also of
the Faith.</p>

<p>I print some extracts from Canon Beeching's
sermon:</p>

<p>"One wonders sometimes," said he, "if
Englishmen have given up reading their gospels.
A book has lately appeared which presents a
caricature of the portrait of Christ, and especially
a travesty of His doctrine about sin, that is quite
astonishing; and with one or two honourable
exceptions the daily and weekly Press have
praised the book enthusiastically, and especially
the study it gives of the character of Christ;
whereas, if that picture were true, the Pharisees
were right when they said to Him that He cast
out devils through Beelzebub, and the priests
were right in sending Him to death as a perverter
of the people. The writer of the book,
who is dead, was a man of exceptional literary
talent, who fell into disgrace; and whether it
is pity for his sad fate or admiration of his
style in writing that has cast a spell upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
reviewers and blinded them to his meaning, I
cannot say; but I do say they have not done
their duty to English society by lauding the
book as they have done, without giving parents
and guardians some hint that it preaches a
doctrine of sin, which, if taken into romantic
and impressionable hearts, will send them quickly
down the road of shame. The chief point on
which the writer fixes is Christ's behaviour to
the sinners; and his theory is that Christ consorted
with them because He found them more
interesting than the good people, who were
stupid. 'The world,' he says, 'had always loved
the saint as being the nearest possible approach
to the perfection of God; Christ, through some
divine instinct in Him, seems to have always
loved the sinner as being the nearest possible
approach to the perfection of man. To turn an
interesting thief into a tedious honest man was
not His aim.... But in a manner not yet
understood of the world He regarded sin and
suffering as being in themselves beautiful and
holy things, and modes of perfection.' It seems
to have struck the writer at this point that our
Lord had Himself explained that He consorted
with sinners, as a physician with the sick, to call
them to repentance. For he goes on:&mdash;'Of
course the sinner must repent; but why?&mdash;simply
because otherwise he would be unable
to realise what he had done.' In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
a man is the better for any sort of emotional
experience, when it is past, because he is fertilised
by it as by a crop of wild oats; a form of
philosophy which Tennyson in 'In Memoriam'
well characterised as 'Procuress to the Lords of
Hell.' But even this writer, absolutely shameless
and unabashed as he is, does not hint that
Christ Himself gained His moral beauty by
sinning. The lowest depth of woe is theirs
who call evil good and good evil, for that is a
poisoning of the well of life. What is the use of
calling Jesus "good" if we destroy the very
meaning of goodness? May God have pardoned
the sin of the man who put this stumbling-block
in the way of the simple, and may He shield our
boys and young men from that doctrine of devils
that the way of perfection lies through sin."</p>

<p>These words, although they are obviously said
without any sympathy whatever for Oscar Wilde,
have the germ of truth within them. Strong as
they are, and no one who had really studied the
whole work and life of Oscar Wilde would perhaps
care to make so fierce a statement, they are,
nevertheless, words of weight and value. I have
no record among my documents of any Catholic
priest who dealt with the Christian aspect of "De
Profundis" upon its publication. Nevertheless,
I have conversed with Christians of all denominations
on the subject of Wilde's "discovery"
of Christ, and I am certain that I am only representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
the Christian point of view when I
state that a wholesale condemnation of the
doctrines Wilde enunciated is the only thing
possible for us. Of the way in which his
doctrines were enunciated no one with a literary
sense and who takes a joy in fine, artistic achievement,
can fail to give a tribute of whole-hearted
praise and admiration.</p>

<p>Let us consider.</p>

<p>Morality, philosophy, religion, Wilde has
already confessed have no controlling force or
power for him. Yet, he takes up the position
of those dim and early seekers after the Presence of
Divinity. He would see "Jesus." Accordingly,
Wilde writes of our Lord very beautifully indeed.
He tells us that the basis of "His nature
was an intense and flame-like imagination....
There is almost something incredible in the
idea of the young Galilean Peasant imagining
that he could bear on his own shoulders the
burden of the entire world&mdash;all that has been
done and suffered, and all that was to be done
and suffered&mdash;and not merely imagining it, but
achieving it."</p>

<p>As another Anglican minister, Canon Gorton,
appointed out at the time, Wilde states that
Christ ranks next to the poets. There is nothing
in the highest drama which can approach the
last act of Christ's Passion. Our Lord becomes,
in Wilde's eyes, the source of all art. He is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
requisite for the beautiful. He is in "Romeo
and Juliet," in "The Winter's Tale" in Provencal
poetry, and in "The Ancient Mariner." "Hence
Christ becomes the palpitating centre of romance,
He has all the colour elements of life, mystery,
strangeness, pathos, suggestion, ecstasy, love."</p>

<p>And then Wilde finally says "that is why he
is so fascinating to artists." This summing up
of the personality and mission of the Saviour of
the world as a mere element in the life of mental
or spiritual pleasure enjoyed by those who are
cultivated to such a life at all, strikes the Christian
man or woman with dismay. It is horrible,
this patronising analysis of the Redeemer as another
and great Dante, merely a supreme artist to
whom artists should bow because of that, and no
more.</p>

<p>Wilde, in fact, definitely states that the
artistic life means for him the tasting in turn
of good and evil, the entertainment of saints
and devils, for the sake of extending the circle of
his friends. He approaches the Personality of
Christ <i>sub specie artis</i>, and only in this way, and
his words are the more terrible to the devout
Christian because they are so beautiful. Do we
not remember, indeed, that once when a young
man knelt to our Lord and called Him "good,"
the Saviour put him aside? Does it not strike
one that there is something very nearly blasphemous
in the man who had lived the consciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
antinomian life that Oscar Wilde lived
daring to call the Saviour idyllic, poetic, dramatic,
charming, fascinating? Does not the poet use
the personality of our Lord as a mere peg on
which to hang his own gorgeous and jewelled
imagery, a reed through which he should make
his own artistic music? Our Lord did not come
into the world to win admiration but to win the
soul from sin. His appeal was not to our
imagination, but to our dormant souls to rouse
and strengthen them.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde writes of Jesus, but there is no
Cross. There is a Saviour, but no repentance,
no renewal, of life, no effort after Holiness.</p>

<p>It is terrible, indeed, to think of the poor unhappy
author striving to appreciate Jesus, though
surely even his blind semi-appreciation of the
Personality of our Lord was better than none at
all, and then to know that even the little germ
of truth which seemed to have come into his life
was forgotten and pushed away when once more
the "appreciator" of Jesus of Nazareth returned
to the world.</p>

<p>As an English minister pointed out, the moral
of Wilde's attitude towards the Christian Faith
is as old as Scripture itself, and as modern as
Browning also, who, in the painter's question&mdash;"gave
art, and what more wish you?" replied&mdash;</p>

<p>Finally we have to ask ourselves what is the
precise value of this last legacy Oscar Wilde
has left to us? I think it is just this. We have
upon our shelves a piece of incomparable prose.
I know of nothing written in recent years that
comes anywhere near it as an almost flawless
work of art. Nobody who cares for English
literature or who understands in the least degree,
what fine writing is and means, will ever neglect
this minor classic. From another point of view
also, it has its value. We who appreciate the
immense genius of Oscar Wilde and mourn for
a wrecked life and the extinction of a bright
intellect, will care for and treasure this volume
for its personal pathos, its high and serene beauty
of expression, and also because, as a psychological
document, it throws a greater light upon
the extraordinary brain and personality of its
author than anything he had written in the past.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
